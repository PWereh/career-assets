Since April 2023, Sudan has endured an unprecedented humanitarian crisis due to the ongoing devastating conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). Over half the population now needs urgent humanitarian and protection assistance, including 16 million children. Acute food insecurity has reached historic levels, with famine conditions confirmed in parts of North Darfur and millions at immediate risk of famine, particularly in conflict-affected regions of Darfur, Khartoum, and Kordofan.

More than 8 million people have been displaced internally since the conflict, making Sudan the world's largest internal displacement crisis, while over 3 million have fled to neighbouring countries. Basic services have collapsed, vaccination rates have plummeted, and violence—including sexual and gender-based violence—has reached horrifying levels. Women and children are disproportionately affected, with millions out of school and experiencing or at grave risk of abuse and exploitation.

In April 2024, the UN and its partners launched a Famine Prevention Plan to scale up lifesaving aid, cash assistance, and community-based interventions, while advocating for expanded humanitarian access. Despite operating in one of the world’s most challenging environments, humanitarian actors have reached 12.7 million people with critical assistance in 2024.

The gravity of the humanitarian crisis in Sudan underscores the urgent need for conflict de-escalation and unrestricted humanitarian access, including across borders and conflict lines, to fight famine and enable broader humanitarian action. We call on all parties to facilitate this access and ensure the protection of humanitarian operations on the ground. We also urge the international community to provide immediate, additional, and flexible funding. This support is crucial for enabling humanitarian partners to expand critical lifesaving aid, including cash assistance, and protection services to those in desperate need.

As we move into 2025, sustained and expanded efforts will be essential to address the impact of this escalating crisis. The 2025 Humanitarian Needs Response Plan seeks US$4.2 billion to deliver lifesaving aid to almost 21 million most vulnerable people, restore basic services, and scale-up protection.

The centrality of protection must remain at the forefront of the humanitarian response in Sudan, ensuring vulnerable populations are shielded from further harm, while addressing pervasive risks of abuse, exploitation, and violence. It will continue to be integrated across all sectors to uphold the dignity, safety, and rights of those affected by the crisis, in particular women and girls. Without urgent collective action, the humanitarian situation will continue to deteriorate, exacerbating the suffering of millions of people.

After more than 20 months of relentless conflict, Sudan has become one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises. Ongoing armed conflict and attacks against civilians, displacement, hunger, malnutrition, disease outbreaks, and climate shocks have left nearly two-thirds of the population in desperate need of humanitarian assistance and protection services.

An estimated 11.5 million people are forcibly displaced in Sudan, including 2.7 million displaced prior to April 2023, making Sudan the largest internal displacement crisis in the world. Children make up well over half of the displaced population.

Sudan is also experiencing an unprecedented food security crisis, with close to 26 million people facing acute food insecurity as of late September 2024 and expected even to further worsen. The situation is particularly dire for those trapped in active conflict zones, including Aj Jazirah, North Darfur and Khartoum states, and the Kordofan region. In late July, famine conditions were confirmed in Zamzam camp in North Darfur, with similar conditions likely in other displacement sites in the area, and many other locations at imminent risk.

Even before the current conflict, Sudan had a global acute malnutrition (GAM) rate of 13.6 per cent among children under five, ranking it among the top four countries globally for the highest GAM rates, alongside India, South Sudan and Yemen. Recent nutrition surveys indicate a deteriorating situation, with 30 out 38 SMART surveys reporting GAM levels of 15 percent or higher, which is classified as a WHO emergency level. Notably, three surveys recorded GAM rates of 30 percent and above, reaching the famine threshold. The 2025 outlook suggests further deterioration in acute malnutrition cases among children under five and pregnant and breast-feeding women. This might exceed the estimated needs, especially as the conflict intensified with the onset of the dry season in October 2024.

In addition to the widening conflict, climate shocks —including unusually heavy rains and flooding— and disease outbreaks, like cholera and measles, are exacerbating humanitarian needs. The conflict has upended the lives of 24 million children, with over 17 million out of school, creating a generational catastrophe. School-aged girls face additional threats, including child marriage, female genital mutilation, and sexual exploitation and abuse, which can significantly exacerbate the barriers to their return to school. These factors deepen the cycle of gender-based vulnerabilities, further entrenching limited opportunities and perpetuating inequality.

Civilians continue to bear the brunt of armed violence. The fighting has led to mass displacement and appalling patterns of sexual violence against women and girls, indiscriminate bombardment of civilian areas, widespread damage and destruction of civilian infrastructure, attacks on healthcare facilities and ethnically motivated killings. Children continue to be killed and maimed, subjected to sexual violence, recruited by armed actors and denied essential services and humanitarian assistance. The number of people at risk of gender-based violence (GBV) has tripled since the conflict started in April 2023, now totalling over 12 million women, girls, men, and boys. In addition, most conflict-affected areas have become heavily contaminated by large-scale explosive hazards.

Access to essential services has sharply declined due to the conflict. Less than 25 per cent of health facilities remain functional in the hardest-hit areas and national vaccination coverage has plummeted from 85 per cent before the conflict to around 50 per cent. In active conflict zones vaccination rates are averaging 30 per cent. Schools are closed in many parts of the country, and water and sanitation systems are at breaking point, compounding the spiralling risks faced by women and girls. An ongoing telecommunications blackout across much of the country, including Darfur, Kordofan and Khartoum, is cutting millions of people off from access to life-saving information, as well as banking and other services.

The levels of need are staggering. While assistance is reaching many areas, with local communities and networks playing an indispensable role, humanitarian access challenges severely limit the ability of humanitarian organizations to scale up, especially in active conflict zones where needs are generally most acute.

### Defining the crisis: shocks, impacts and people affected

The 2025 HNRP is underpinned by a joint analysis of humanitarian needs in Sudan based on three key shocks: conflict, floods, and disease outbreaks, and their impact on the population and essential services. The analysis encompasses the entire country, recognizing the widespread impact of these three identified shocks affecting a significant portion of the population in Sudan, although the severity of impact varies across different geographic areas. While the entire country is grappling with the consequences of these shocks, specific geographic areas, such as North Darfur, Aj Jazirah, Sennar, and West Kordofan, have experienced heightened levels of displacement and humanitarian needs. In addition to geographic factors, certain population groups are particularly vulnerable. These include internally displaced persons (IDPs), refugees, women, children, older people and individuals with disabilities.

### People in Need and Severity of Needs

The 2025 HNRP scope will focus on four population groups: IDPs, host communities, non-hosting and refugees’ populations at the locality level (administrative level 2) across all Sudan. This focus is based on an analysis of the impacts of conflict, floods, and disease outbreaks. The joint and inter-cluster analysis underpinning the assessment of humanitarian needs in Sudan was conducted geographically at the locality level, covering 188 localities across the country, excluding the Abyei area.

**Sudan's humanitarian crisis deteriorated, with the population in need of humanitarian assistance and protection dramatically increasing.** Throughout 2024, Sudan experienced famine conditions, relentless flooding , and continuing conflict with limited humanitarian access in areas of hostilities. These compounding factors have rendered an estimated 30.4 million people, a staggering 64 per cent of the total 47.5 million population, in need of humanitarian assistance. This number marks a significant 23 per cent increase, compared to the 24.8 million people estimated to be in need in the 2024 HNRP. The escalating conflict and limited humanitarian access and capacity are key factors driving this dramatic deterioration of the situation.

**A staggering 2.3 million people across 9 localities****, primarily in Darfur and Kordofan, are facing a catastrophic level of humanitarian need**. The crisis is further exacerbated by the alarming rise in severe and extreme needs. Forty-five localities are teetering on the brink of catastrophe due to high malnutrition rates, the threat of famine, cholera outbreak, and systematic violations of Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law at a horrifying magnitude. Forty-four of the 45 localities have escalated from severe in 2024 to extreme need, affecting an additional 6.5 million people. This alarming escalation underscores the deepening crisis in Sudan.

**Of the 30.4 million people in need (PiN), 14.3 million (47 per cent) are non-hosting populations, 8.9 million (29 per cent) are IDPs, 6.4 million (21 per cent) are host communities and 0.89 million (3 per cent) are refugees.** Notably, children and women constitute a significant portion of the affected population – 51 per cent are children and 50 per cent are women and girls – while people with disabilities are estimated to comprise 15 per cent of PiN - equivalent to 4.7 million.

**The most critical areas of need are concentrated in South Darfur, Aj Jazirah, Khartoum, and North Darfur,** where a combined 11.4 million people (38 per cent of the total PiN) require urgent assistance. The Darfur region faces a particularly dire humanitarian crisis, with 79 per cent of its population in need of humanitarian assistance and protection. Kordofan follows closely with 61 per cent of the population in need, while Khartoum stands at 48 per cent.

**Significant increases of the PiN were observed in North Kordofan (96 per cent), Aj Jazirah (93 per cent), West Kordofan (85 per cent), Gederef (80 per cent), Sennar and Red Sea (74 per cent), and East Darfur (56 per cent).** These increases reflect heightened humanitarian needs due to new displacements, limited humanitarian access, and ongoing conflict. Conversely, decreases were recorded in West Darfur, Central Darfur and South Kordofan, regions bordering Chad and South Sudan, which have historically served as sources of refugees and asylum seekers.

**A critical intersection of high PiN and severe humanitarian needs is evident in Aj Jazirah, Khartoum State, and the Darfur and Kordofan regions**. These areas face particularly acute humanitarian challenges, driven by the ongoing conflict and displacement. Meanwhile, localities like Sennar, Shendi, and Medinat Kassala exhibit high PiN levels primarily due to the influx of IDPs from neighbouring states. However, the ongoing humanitarian response has somewhat mitigated the severity of the situation in these areas.

**Food Security, WASH, Health and Protection are among the top needs in the largest number of areas with high PiN and high severity.** While PiN for acute malnutrition is lower in absolute numbers as the interventions specifically target children under the age of five years and pregnant and breastfeeding women, it is widely prevalent at emergency and catastrophic levels in Sudan, putting children’s lives at risk. This suggests a critical need for an integrated package of assistance in these sectors to address the most pressing humanitarian needs and have a major impact.

**Critical protection concerns and access to food and basic services primarily drive the intersectoral severity of needs.** These include direct and continued attacks on civilians as well as vital civilian infrastructure, such as hospitals and schools. Such breaches pose direct threats to life, severely hinder people’s access to basic services essential for survival and compromise their freedom of movement. Women and girls increasingly face a persistent and growing risk of GBV, including sexual violence, gang rape, abduction and enslavement allegedly committed by the warring parties.

**Displacement remains a major driver of need and vulnerability in Sudan.** The influx of displaced populations, coupled with the absence of critical services in displacement locations, has significantly exacerbated the humanitarian crisis. There is an increased trend in secondary displacements and tertiary displacements across the country, further disrupting the lives of displaced populations and driving needs. Moreover, the responsibility of hosting IDPs by families and within communities has led to a significant increase in the needs of non-displaced and hosting populations and pressure on the already limited basic services.

**The economic downturn and inflationary measures are aggravating the situation.** Long queues in commercial banks are a common sight in most parts of the country. In addition, the exchange rate reform has created a parallel forex market thus limiting access to much needed liquidity to import basic food items. In 2024, Sudan recorded a 50 per cent reduction in employment and business opportunities in urban areas, and the average prices of basic food items have also exponentially increased. In April 2024, the price of wheat was twice that of the previous year and about five times the three-year average.

**Massive floods and outbreaks of cholera** **and other communicable diseases further exacerbated the humanitarian situation.** This was further worsened by limited and inadequate health services to manage cholera and other communicable diseases, such as malaria and dengue fever. Many of the fatalities due to cholera are among displaced and refugee children under five years of age.

### Humanitarian outlook and risks

Sudan ranks 8th in the world in terms of humanitarian severity, according to the [INFORM risk index](https://drmkc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/inform-index) in 2025. Its “very high” risk classification is driven by high scores against multiple key indicators, including projected conflict risk, current highly violent conflict intensity, vulnerability, and developmental deprivation, among other factors.

The 2025 risk analysis for Sudan, which assessed hazards and their potential impacts on people, infrastructure, and the environment, identified several high-probability risks. These include the ongoing escalation of political conflict, which is likely to affect the entire country, with continued violence against civilians and large-scale displacement. Active hostilities are anticipated to affect multiple states throughout 2025, exacerbated by a heightened risk of communal and ethnic violence. Additional risks include potential economic deterioration and accelerating inflation, significantly reduced harvests for 2024/2025, as well as the risk of floods and the spread of waterborne and vector-borne diseases.

The evolution of the crisis remains highly unpredictable in 2025 with critical humanitarian implications, according to the [Sudan Crisis Risk Analysis for 2025](https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/sudan-crisis-risk-analysis-2025-25-october-2024). Sudan's conflict is likely to persist, with risk of competition for the control of strategic regions, like Khartoum, Sennar and West Kordofan, at risk of aggravating further. The limited progress in mediation efforts and the imposition of international sanctions could further escalate tensions, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis and continuing mass displacement. The situation remains highly volatile, with limited prospects for a political solution in the near future. Fighting is expected to persist in Khartoum, Kordofan, Darfur (particularly in Al Fasher in North Darfur), Sennar, White Nile, and Aj Jazirah states.

The ongoing conflict has further complicated pre-existing ethnic tensions, exacerbating communal disputes and divisions. In particular, inter-communal tensions in Greater Darfur remain a significant concern and are likely to persist, even if the broader conflict comes to an end.

In addition to the challenges of ongoing conflict and an unprecedented scale of humanitarian needs and access impediments, some of the underlying risks driven by economic crisis and climate change could further aggravate the situation. The risk of partial economic collapse and accelerating inflation are highly likely, with a potential for severe impact. The conflict has delivered a crippling blow to Sudan's fragile economy. Following an estimated 18 per cent economic contraction in 2023, Sudan’s GDP is expected to fall a further 5.9 per cent in 2024and . With no end to the conflict in sight, the economy is expected to continue a downward trajectory resulting in a devastating impact on household purchasing power.

Sudan's vulnerability to climate change is also concerning, ranking among the world's ten most at-risk nations. The El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) creates irregular periodic variation in the temperature as well as sea surface temperature, thus influencing year-to-year variability and extreme weather events. In 2020, Sudan witnessed its most severe flooding in a century, affecting over 800,000 individuals, and in 2022, more than 349,000 people were affected. By November 2024, the number of people affected by flooding has reached over 685,000, with heavier than normal rains driven by El Niño-related weather phenomenon. For 2025, more accurate estimates of climate variance will only be possible at the start of the year.

Without a significant shift in the current trajectory, Sudan's humanitarian situation is projected to further deteriorate in 2025. The ongoing conflict, characterized by intense fighting in key areas, like Khartoum, Kordofan, Darfur, Sennar, White Nile, and Aj Jazirah, will likely exacerbate the humanitarian crisis. Increased displacement, limited humanitarian access, and a rise in inter-communal violence are expected to further strain resources and services. Urgent and sustained humanitarian intervention will be essential to mitigate the suffering of millions of people in Sudan.

Required to support 20.9M people

US$4.2B

As Sudan’s humanitarian crisis enters its third year of conflict in early 2025, the new Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan is focused on addressing rapidly escalating needs in a constantly changing and complex operational environment. With millions of people facing extreme deprivation, displacement, and violence, the response aims to alleviate suffering and prevent further deterioration, carefully balancing urgent priorities with the constraints imposed by the ongoing conflict.

The 2025 response plan seeks to support 20.9 million people with urgent life-saving assistance and services, requiring $4.2 billion in funding. The planning process has considered the severity of needs in conflict-affected regions, including Darfur, Kordofan, and Khartoum, and the urgent need to secure unhindered access for humanitarian workers and supplies.

### Key strategic elements

- **Addressing Access Impediments:** Strengthening principled engagement with all parties and advocating for the protection of civilians and local responders, ensuring the realization of the commitments set out in the Jeddah Declaration of Commitment to Protect the Civilians of Sudan are of paramount importance. The Joint Operating Principles (JOPs) endorsed by the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) will continue to be leveraged, alongside scaling up cross-border operations from Chad and crossline access through all accessible crossing points.
- **Advancing Localization and Grassroots Community Networks:** Promoting localization and empowering grassroots community networks are central to enhancing the humanitarian response. The localization strategy emphasizes fostering equitable partnerships with national NGOs (NNGOs), while prioritizing sustainable, community-led solutions that build the resilience of those most affected by the crisis. To achieve this, the response strategy underscores the importance of providing financial support and capacity-building initiatives to Mutual Aid Groups (MAGs), ensuring that underserved areas receive context-sensitive and effective assistance.
- **Preventing Encampment:** Developing a clear operational strategy to support IDPs in host communities, maintaining solidarity, and preventing encampment in environments not conducive to safe returns is equally important.
- **Centrality of Protection**: Prioritization of the inclusion and rights of vulnerable groups—such as minorities, women, children, people with disabilities, and older individuals—ensures equitable access to humanitarian assistance. Cluster capacities will be strengthened to address specific protection needs, promote inclusive practices, and empower community-led responses, particularly through the leadership of women-led organizations and organizations of people with disabilities, while advancing localization principles.
- **Mitigating GBV Risks:** The implementation of action plans based on the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) guidelines to reduce GBV risks across all clusters and ensure safe access to services for vulnerable populations. Efforts will focus on strengthening national and community-based systems for GBV prevention and care.
- **Promoting Gender Equality and Empowering Women and Girls in Humanitarian Action:** Grounded in the IASC Policy on Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women and Girls in Humanitarian Action (GEEWG), the response strategy will integrate gender considerations across all phases of intervention. This includes ensuring the active and meaningful participation of women and girls in humanitarian decision-making processes with the coordination and technical support of the Gender in Humanitarian Action Working Group.
- **Strengthening Integrated Response**: Clusters will continue efforts to scale up humanitarian response, which will include efforts on delivering minimum multi-sectoral package of services to strengthen integrated response. This will aim at increasing the positive impact of humanitarian response and coordination in service delivery.
- **Scaling up Multipurpose Cash Assistance (MPCA):** MPCA and group transfers will help enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the response, addressing the diverse needs of conflict-affected households. The Cash Working Group (CWG) and Cluster Coordinators will work together to improve coordination, reduce duplication and strengthen referral pathways to ensure at risk individuals receive assistance in a timely and accountable manner.

## 2.2 Response Boundary-Setting, Prioritization and Risk-Informed Action

![Ad Dammar Northern State, Sudan, Amira Adam Ahmed is 40 years old, pregnant and a mother of seven children. She is to deliver by cesarean, and she is also malnourished with anemia.

Despite Sudan's substantial humanitarian needs, financial requirements are constrained by a challenging operating environment marked by unstable, unpredictable, and unsafe access in certain areas. This restricts the reach of humanitarian efforts. In 2024, the humanitarian community managed to assist 12.7 million people, reaching 87 per cent of its target with some form of humanitarian assistance.

While the aim of the humanitarian community is to reach the 20.9 million people targeted, in order to ensure that those at higher risk and facing the most dire conditions are assisted first; the response prioritizes urgent needs, especially for internally displaced and conflict-affected populations, balancing these needs with the realities of limited access, operational capacity, and staff safety in an unpredictable and volatile setting.

The prioritization is guided by:

- Focusing on localities with intersectoral severity 5, those at risk of famine, areas with high GAM rates (>30%), high cholera case fatality rates (CFR), localities with more than four Clusters in severity 4, with one Cluster at severity 5, including protection.
- Ensuring that activities remain strictly humanitarian, and that resilience-building and development initiatives are incorporated in complementary frameworks.

This prioritization ensures that 54 localities across Sudan will be prioritized encompassing all three population groups, while also including all IDPs residing outside these prioritized localities. Clusters may also prioritize people with cluster specific high severity needs, including those who fall outside of inter-sectoral geographical prioritization, to ensure children and families with severe needs are not left behind, e.g. children under-five with severe acute malnutrition; or people using untreated surface water sources.

Given the dynamic operational landscape, the HCT will closely monitor the response plan throughout 2025, adjusting the approach as and when conditions change. If significant changes in the context and shifts occur, such as improved access to previously "hard-to-reach" areas and significant population movements, the plan will be revised and adjusted to incorporate additional activities and resources needed to enhance the response effectively. A mid-term review is also envisaged, under the overall guidance of the HCT.

## 2.4 Strategic Objectives

![Sudan, Empowering Women farmers through WE-RISE Project UN Women.](https://humanitarianaction.info/sites/default/files/styles/14x5_1400/public/article-images/Empowering%2520Women%2520farmers%2520through%2520WE-RISE%2520Project_UN%2520Women.jpg.webp)

**Strategic Objective 1**

Provide safe, timely, principled, and gender-responsive humanitarian assistance to the most vulnerable groups to reduce mortality and morbidity in areas with high severity of need or at risk of further deterioration of critical humanitarian needs.

Under this strategic objective, partners are focused on reaching 14.3 million people with life-saving interventions across various sectors, supported by enhanced logistics, emergency communication, and coordinated response efforts.

**Strategic Objective 2**

Provide direct responses to the protection needs arising from the crisis for affected women, men, girls, and boys, especially those who are most vulnerable and marginalized and ensure that assistance and advocacy are guided by the principles of protection, conflict sensitivity, and inclusivity across gender and diversity, in accordance with international norms and standards, and prevent and reduce emerging protection risks.

This objective aims to improve living and protection conditions for vulnerable IDPs, host communities, and residents by ensuring equitable and safe access to assistance and protection. To provide specialized, multisectoral services sensitive to gender, age, and disability, including support for survivors of violence, neglect, abuse and those with specific needs. The response will ensure access to conflict and gender-sensitive protection services, which also supports access to adequate living conditions and sustainable livelihoods. The response will be localized and people-centred, involving crisis-affected individuals in decision-making to promote accountability to affected populations (AAP).

The objective targets the protection needs of 3.5 million individuals, ensuring that risks are minimized and a supportive environment for respect, protection, and fulfilment of rights is established.

**Strategic Objective 3**

Provide safe, equitable, dignified, and unhindered access to critical basic services for the most vulnerable groups to prevent further erosion of their coping abilities.

This objective aims to safeguard the well-being of 4.3 million vulnerable people and prevent further decline in their coping mechanisms.

## 2.5 Planning Assumptions, Operational Capacity and Access, and Response Trends

![Sudan, UNMAS EO safety briefing to WFP drivers delivering 20 trucks of aid items.](https://humanitarianaction.info/sites/default/files/styles/14x5_1400/public/article-images/UNMAS%2520EO%2520safety%2520briefing%2520to%2520WFP%2520drivers%2520delivering%252020%2520trucks%2520of%2520aid%2520items_2024-09-17.jpg.webp)

**Overview**

While the operational context in 2025 is expected to remain challenging, partners will continue to exert all efforts to maintain and expand their physical presence and to increase their capacity to respond and reach vulnerable populations. In addition to the conflict, challenges with regard to security, rule of law, bureaucratic impediments and armed group dynamics will add to the complexity of the operational environment for partners to deliver humanitarian assistance and services. As humanitarian needs rise, partners aim to strengthen local partnerships, enhance community response capacity, and expand their physical presence.

**Planning Assumptions**

Without a political solution, Sudan's situation will likely worsen in 2025, with rising inflation deepening economic hardships and increasing the cost of the humanitarian response. Sudan will face continuing humanitarian needs, with access hindered by bureaucratic hurdles imposed by the parties to the conflict. Displacement will likely continue at scale, and potential cross-border movements from eastern Sudanese states to Ethiopia may be likely in the event of an expansion of the conflict to Gedaref and Kassala. Conflict will likely continue in Aj Jazirah, Darfur, Khartoum, North Kordofan and Sennar. Those states not directly experiencing conflict in 2025 – such as Red Sea or River Nile – may see the expansion of the conflict, and a continuation of the deterioration of the local economy. Alternatively, frontlines between both parties may shift west, resulting in new population movements, and possibly renewed access to areas heavily affected by recent hostilities.

**Operational Capacity**

In 2024, partners have gradually re-established the physical presence in Sudan that existed before April 2023, overcoming challenges to resume operations in eastern Sudan and parts of Darfur. Efforts in continuing to scale up physical presence will continue in 2025. INGO and UN partners will continue to rely on national staff and NNGO partners to reach vulnerable populations in areas that are difficult to access, such as Darfur, Aj Jazirah and Khartoum states, where international staff presence is extremely limited or inexistent. Given ongoing access and operational constraints, the 2025 plan focuses on strengthening local partnerships and advancing localization to reach hard-to-access areas. These partnerships will ensure the effective delivery of critical services where international staff presence and access remain limited.

In 2025, 60 international NGO partners, 13 UN agencies, 91 national NGO partners and three international organizations will be working together to implement the Sudan response plan. Reliance on and partnerships with local partners and Mutual Aid Groups will persist and likely grow with constrained access in areas like Khartoum. The scale up of inter-agency common hubs in Atbara, Zalingei, Kassala, Kadugli and Kosti will continue, access and security conditions permitting.

**Access Constraints and Challenges**

Access to humanitarian services and assistance remains extremely challenging and unpredictable. Insufficient field presence and incomplete humanitarian coordination structures severely hamper the humanitarian community and its response in those areas that have the highest levels of humanitarian need, vulnerability and protection issues. Expanding the UN presence, alongside national and international NGOs, will enable UN agencies to monitor aid delivery, ensuring assistance is meeting needs and reaching intended recipients, and strengthen “protection by presence” approach. Expanded humanitarian field presence would facilitate dialogue with uniformed personnel, community leaders, and influential tribal or local administrations, promoting strong relationships to ensure adherence to humanitarian principles and accountability in cases of suspected violations across Sudan.

A one-year period in Sudan can be divided into two parts; the rainy season where physical constraints such as floods and damaged infrastructure present major logistical and physical access challenges, but subdues the fighting capacity of the parties to conflict, and the dry season where increased humanitarian movements and, as seen in 2024, military operations are possible.

Bureaucratic access restrictions are common in both SAF and RSF-controlled areas. Travel permits or movement notifications are frequently delayed or withheld for crossline and cross-border transport, causing delays and cancellations that prevent aid convoys from reaching those in need.

The Humanitarian Access Working Group (HAWG) will build on its 2024 efforts to analyze access challenges and provide timely recommendations to the HCT to guide strategic decisions and advocacy. This work relies on more systematized humanitarian access reporting across Sudan in alignment with OCHA’s global access monitoring and reporting framework (AMRF). OCHA is prioritizing making the means of reporting to AMRF more comprehensive, inclusive and simple, with relevant, useful analysis of trends and clearer feedback loops on the actions taken to resolve and address reported challenges. The Access Severity Overview methodology will be reviewed to complement the access situation overview presented by the AMRF, with periodic snapshots of how humanitarians rate access constraints, state by state.

**Response Trend**

An average of 9.3 million people were reached with some form of humanitarian assistance between 2020 and 2024. In 2023, out of the 18.1 million people targeted in the HNRP, 45 per cent were reached by the end of the year. In 2024, 87 per cent of the 14.7 million targeted were reached with some form of humanitarian assistance as of 30 November, an average of 2.5 million people reached over the past few months of 2024. Different levels of funding, insecurity, and access constraints continued to pose challenges to the humanitarian response in 2024.

## 2.6. Accountable, Inclusive and Quality Programming

![Port Land Reception Center in Gedaref State, Sudan, This center hosts tens of thousands of people displaced from Khartoum and neighboring states since the conflict began on 15 April 2023. ](https://humanitarianaction.info/sites/default/files/styles/14x5_1400/public/article-images/Nov%25202024_Gaderef%2520Visit-42.jpg.webp)

**Accountability to Affected People and People-Centered Response**

The Accountability to Affected People (AAP) and people-centred response in Sudan ensures that communities are at the heart of decision-making and response implementation. The AAP Working Group (AAP WG) leads this effort by systematically consulting diverse groups within affected people, such as women and girls, older people, and people with disabilities, to shape the humanitarian response. Communities are engaged through two-way communication channels, including help desks, hotlines, and digital platforms, allowing for continuous feedback and adjustment of strategies. The response also emphasizes local participation, empowering local actors like NGOs and community-based organizations, to take leadership roles through the creation of community-led AAP hubs.

The AAP WG has established a common inter-agency Complaints and Feedback Mechanism (CFM) to enhance accountability and ensure that feedback informs decision-making. The group’s strategic priorities for 2024-2025 include improving coordination with stakeholders, strengthening community engagement and integrating cross-cutting issues, like gender equality, disability inclusion, and conflict awareness. Localization is a key goal, with efforts focused on building local capacity and transitioning leadership to community-based entities. By fostering transparency, trust, and accountability, the response ensures that assistance is accessible, equitable, and respectful of the rights and dignity of all affected populations.

**Centrality of Protection**

The centrality of protection is a critical priority in Sudan's humanitarian response due to widespread risks of violence, coercion, and deprivation from the ongoing conflict and intercommunal tensions. The 2025 HNRP will build on efforts in 2024 to address protection needs by integrating protection mainstreaming across all clusters and ensuring the inclusion of vulnerable groups such as women, children, and people with disabilities. The Protection Cluster and Inclusion Task Force will provide support to enhance the capacity of humanitarian partners to identify and assist those at heightened risk. Empowering community-led organizations, particularly women and disability groups, and ensuring equitable, non-discriminatory access to services will be central. The inter-agency complaint mechanism will ensure the affected population's voice is considered in humanitarian interventions.

**Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse**

The HCT takes a collective, zero-tolerance approach to Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (SEA), integrating Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA) into all coordination mechanisms and humanitarian response. The Sudan PSEA Network, disrupted by conflict in 2023, re-invigorated its activities with the establishment of a Strategic Advisory Group (SAG) to provide strategic direction. This multi-agency effort, aligned with the IASC Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse and Harassment (PSEAH) Vision and Strategy (2022–2026), focuses on risk mitigation, prevention, and response, emphasizing victim/survivor-centred assistance through safe, accessible reporting channels and community-based complaint mechanisms (CBCMs). PSEA efforts prioritize engaging affected populations in a culturally appropriate manner, addressing socio-cultural barriers and stigma.

To strengthen accountability, the 2024-2025 PSEA Country Action Plan includes GBV risk mitigation measures, recognizing the intersection between GBV and SEA. The response applies to a survivor-centred, gender-transformative approach, ensuring confidentiality, safety, and dignity for survivors. Monitoring mechanisms are in place, supported by a dedicated inter-agency PSEA coordinator, with field-level assessments guiding response adjustments. Additionally, community outreach campaigns using diverse communication channels will raise awareness about PSEA and reporting mechanisms. All activities are aimed at enhancing trust, increasing reporting, and improving the overall safety of affected populations, especially women and girls.

**Gender, Age, Disability and Other Diversities – Sensitivity and Empowerment**

The ongoing conflict in Sudan is disproportionately affecting women, girls, and other at-risk groups, such as people with disabilities, exacerbating pre-existing gender inequalities and reversing progress in gender equality and human rights gains. The humanitarian crisis, characterized by mass displacement, food insecurity, and the weaponization of sexual violence, has severe consequences for these groups. Women and girls – that make up more than half of displaced people – face significant barriers to accessing humanitarian assistance, including healthcare, clean water, and essential services. These demographic groups face heightened risks of malnutrition, GBV, life-threatening outcomes during childbirth and a lack of access to reproductive health services, further compounding their vulnerability.

Food insecurity in Sudan is not gender neutral. Women and girls are often the last to eat, and female-headed households are facing food insecurity at twice the rate of male-headed households. Water scarcity forces women and girls to travel long distances, putting them at greater risk, while menstrual hygiene needs remain severely unmet, leading to negative health outcomes. The absence of critical sexual and reproductive health services heightens risks of maternal mortality and reproductive health complications, especially for pregnant and breastfeeding women in conflict zones.

The escalation of GBV, including sexual violence, forced marriage, and human trafficking places 12.1 million women and girls at heightened risk, resulting in 400 per cent increase in the provision of GBV specialized services. Disruption in education, especially for school-aged girls, compounds the crisis, increasing the risks of child marriage, sexual exploitation, and a rollback of gender equality gains, while also limiting future economic opportunities for young women.

Despite these challenges, women-led organizations and female volunteers have played crucial roles in frontline humanitarian efforts. They lead emergency response initiatives in hard-to-reach areas, particularly food distribution and famine prevention. However, they face significant risks, including violence and marginalization in decision-making processes. To empower these vital first responders, increased, direct, flexible, and long-term funding is necessary to support their efforts and ensure they can continue to meet the urgent needs of women and girls across Sudan. The Gender in Humanitarian Action Working Group (GiHA WG) supports gender integration across the humanitarian response and monitors compliance with the IASC GEEWG policy.

Since the conflict began in April 2023, the humanitarian response in Sudan has faced immense challenges. Despite these obstacles, considerable efforts have been directed toward sustaining early recovery, resilience-building, and durable solutions through the United Nations Common Approach and Priorities for 2024-2025. Recognizing the ongoing crisis, the Common Approach has been extended through 2025 to align with the 2025 HNRP, which prioritizes the delivery of multisectoral, lifesaving humanitarian assistance to the most vulnerable populations. By fostering connections between early recovery initiatives and durable solutions actors, these frameworks collectively promote a cohesive, sustainable approach to medium- and long-term resilience and development.

Immediate humanitarian response and assistance, through the HNRP, focuses on addressing critical needs such as food security, essential public health, nutrition, WASH, protection, education and shelter, but it does not tackle deeper, medium to longer-term structural recovery and development challenges, including poverty alleviation, employment generation, or system strengthening. The responsibility for addressing these challenges rests with the national authorities, who work alongside development partners, including through the UN Common Approach for Sudan. While the humanitarian community continues to provide urgent emergency humanitarian assistance, medium to longer-term structural issues - including preserving and sustaining service provision systems and mitigating the socioeconomic impacts of the ongoing conflict through resilience building and community stabilization - remain the focus of the Government of Sudan and its development partners.Bottom of Form

The UN Common Approach framework provides a unified set of recovery and development goals and priorities for the UN System, complementing the immediate life-saving humanitarian response outlined in the HNRP. These frameworks prioritize medium- to long-term areas such as infrastructure reconstruction, livelihoods, job creation, mine action, housing, debris removal, energy, environment, and social protection. Additionally, they highlight critical sectors like education, healthcare, as well as cross-cutting issues such as data generation, institutional capacity building, and inclusive economic growth. By aligning all interventions with the government’s criteria and priorities, these frameworks ensure local relevance and effectiveness, fostering a seamless humanitarian-development nexus. This approach lays the foundation for a more resilient and sustainable future for Sudan, bridging immediate relief efforts with long-term peace, recovery and development.

Furthermore, under the overall leadership of the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator, linkages across the development and humanitarian frameworks will be strengthened in 2025, looking at the nexus between humanitarian, early recovery and development to better coordinate assistance and enable complementarities.

## 2.8. Cost of the Response

![West Darfur, Sudan, WFP and World Relief providing emergency food and nutrition assistance in West Darfur.](https://humanitarianaction.info/sites/default/files/styles/14x5_1400/public/article-images/WFP_World%2520Relief.JPG.webp)

### Costing methodology

The 2025 response plan uses a unit-based costing methodology in estimating the financial requirements (US$4.16 billion) to meet the needs of 20.9 million people. This approach enhances accuracy and transparency by directly linking costs to specific activities or units. This method allows for more precise budgeting, aligns resources with prioritized needs, and improves accountability, ensuring that funding is effectively allocated to achieve targeted humanitarian outcomes.

### Changes in the cost of operating

Several key factors drive the cost of humanitarian operations in Sudan:

- **Scale of the crisis:** As one of the largest and worst humanitarian crises in the world, millions of people require assistance, demanding substantial resources to provide the required assistance and services.
- **Complexity and volatility:** The multifaceted nature of the crisis, with multiple underlying causes, complicates the delivery of effective and efficient humanitarian assistance. The unpredictable security situation further hampers operations, often requiring additional resources to mitigate risks for humanitarian workers.
- **Logistical challenges:** Poor infrastructure and limited access to many areas significantly raise the costs of transporting supplies and personnel to where they are most needed.
- **Inflation:** The high cost of basic goods and services in Sudan, driven by inflation, significantly increase the overall operational expenses.

Under the guidance of the global clusters, the clusters in Sudan have conducted different consultations in a country-wide survey to gather estimated unit costs for each activity from core partners, average cost per indicators, estimated costs based on the previous years’ cost per activity, among other methodologies. Costs were adjusted to account for inflation and the varying costs across localities, using an average to ensure all partner inputs were represented.

### Summary of Needs

The ongoing armed conflict in Sudan has deeply disrupted the country's economy and livelihoods. Damage to key infrastructure, including financial service providers and communication networks, has crippled banking services, supply chains, and overall market functionality. Inflation is increasing, and the Sudanese Pound (SDG) has depreciated sharply, worsening economic hardship for millions. The resulting lack of liquidity and dwindling purchasing power have made it difficult for people to access services and exacerbated coping capacities, further increasing the population's vulnerability. Trade dynamics have also shifted, with Sudan now relying on imports from neighbouring countries to which it once exported, creating additional strain on the already fragile market systems.

Despite these immense challenges, markets in Sudan remain active, and cash and voucher assistance (CVA) has proven to be a viable tool to address the humanitarian needs of affected women, men, girls and boys. In particular women and girls in Sudan face heightened risks due to conflict, displacement, and economic instability, including GBV and limited access to essential services and female-headed households often encounter additional barriers to assistance. Humanitarian actors have found innovative ways to deliver CVA despite access constraints and liquidity challenges, as it provides the flexibility needed to respond to demand-driven needs. According to the 2024 Multi-Sectoral Needs Assessment (MSNA), 67 per cent of the surveyed population expressed a preference for CVA over in-kind assistance, highlighting its effectiveness in helping people meet their basic needs. In a context where access to in-kind assistance is constrained, CVA stands as a viable modality to avert famine and stabilize the livelihoods of those caught in the conflict.

### Response Strategy

Humanitarian cash interventions in Sudan have evolved significantly over the years, primarily in response to protracted conflict, displacement, and economic instability. With in-kind assistance facing access constraints and bureaucratic impediments, CVA in Sudan has emerged as a vital and flexible form of assistance where market conditions exist, empowering recipients to address a broad range of essential needs, including food, shelter, access to healthcare, protection and education. Despite the difficult operational environment caused by conflict and economic instability, CVA is preferred by most Sudanese households due to the flexibility it offers, allowing them to prioritize according to their unique circumstances. However, high inflation, economic volatility and protection risks in Sudan pose significant challenges, necessitating regular market and inflation monitoring, adjustment of transfer values and thorough protection risk assessments to ensure that the assistance remains effective, meets people's needs and does no harm.

Multi-purpose cash assistance (MPCA)is an unrestricted form of CVA designed to help vulnerable households meet their basic needs with maximum flexibility and dignity. The endorsed transfer value (TV) as of 1 September 2024 for MPCA is 280,000 SDG per household per month for a duration of three months. The TV is determined using the median Minimum Expenditure Basket (MEB) of Sudan and is regulated by market prices using the Joint Market Monitoring Initiative (JMMI). The MEB consists of the minimum commodities required for a household of six to meet their most basic needs for a month. The transfer amount aims to cover 70 per cent of household needs, ensuring that funding limitations are accounted for, while addressing inflationary pressures. Based on monthly market monitoring, TV is subject to revision in the instance of an increase in the median TV of 15 per cent or higher.

MPCA will prioritize female-headed households and ensure safe, accessible delivery mechanisms, such as discreet distribution points and flexible collection times. In addition, the protection services will be integrated through strong referral pathways for GBV survivors. Additionally, women and girls will actively participate in program design and feedback processes to address their needs. Monitoring will track disaggregated data to ensure accountability and effectiveness. This approach aims to empower women and girls, enhance their safety, and promote dignity and resilience by ensuring their participation in household decision-making processes and addressing their specific needs through MPCA.

### Targeting and Prioritization

In 2025, an estimated $201.8 million is required to reach 1.8 million vulnerable people across Sudan in the form of MPCA and Group Cash Transfers (GCTs), representing a 60 per cent increase from anticipated 2024 MPCA distributions. Cash implementing partners will target inter-sectoral Severity 4 and 5 localities in areas where the Food Security and Livelihood Cluster (FSL) will not cover, integrating data from the MSNA and market functionality (JMMI).Regular MPCA will be disbursed monthly over a period of three months, with the possibility of extension based on needs assessments and funding availability. In cases of sudden emergencies, or newly displaced households, a one-off transfer of the regular MPCA monthly amount will be provided to meet immediate needs. MPCA and group cash transfers (GCTs) will be underpinned by a robust risk protection analysis to ensure risks accessing, receiving and using cash are adequately mitigated. Further, the Sudan Cash Working Group (CWG) will pay particular attention in 2025 to strengthening referral pathways to ensure at risk individuals receive assistance in a timely and accountable manner.

Given the extreme access challenges in Sudan, GCTs are an outstanding instrument to funnel flexible financial support to first responders ensuring assistance reaches the most in need, hard-to-reach areas and address acute humanitarian needs. It offers a strong mechanism to ensure that humanitarian efforts leverage all available options to reach vulnerable populations, particularly in famine and famine-prone areas. By aligning with the cash modality’s unrestricted nature, GCTs reflect and support primary needs of communities.

It is also linked to social protection efforts through UNICEF’s Cash Programme, which adopts a multi-sectoral approach, coordinated through the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Social Affairs as a social safety net linked to critical life-saving services. The programme integrates behaviour change, communication, supplementary feeding, health services, and social worker support to ensure sustainable outcomes from cash transfer activities. It covers 1,000 days of a child's life, emphasizing coverage, sustainability, and service access in consultation with the government. In 2025, some 150,000 households will receive $30 per month per household for 12 months under this programme with an overall funding requirement of $100 million.

### Cash Coordination

The Sudan CWG is the coordination body for MPCA, while sectoral cash and voucher assistance is coordinated by the respective clusters with the CWG providing technical and coordination support. The CWG will support reporting on both MPCA and sectoral cash. The CWG and FSL Cluster have guidance in place to prevent overlap activities. To tackle technical challenges related to CVA implementation, the CWG leads technical working groups on MEB and TV, Financial Service Provider and Liquidity, Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning, and Cash Group Transfers.

### Monitoring

As part of the HNRP 2025 monitoring framework, specific indicators will be used to measure the effectiveness and impact of MPCA:

- Number of households receiving MPCA,
- Percentage of households reporting that MPCA helped them access basic needs,
- Total amount of MPCA delivered,
- Per cent of recipients (disaggregated by sex, age, and disability) reporting humanitarian assistance was delivered in a safe, accessible, accountable, and participatory manner.

Additional indicators such as timeliness of MPCA disbursement, adequacy of transfer value, and impact on food consumption and coping strategies will be monitored by agencies delivering MPCA.

### Situation and Needs Monitoring

Humanitarian needs will be monitored throughout the year to assess risks, context changes, and response implications. The Assessment and Analysis Working Group-led Emergency Monitoring System, which consolidated primary and secondary datasets from different sources, will be used to inform the Inter-Cluster Coordination Group (ICCG) of areas with deteriorating conditions to facilitate response adjustments and, if required, to trigger detailed needs assessments.

Two key risks (floods and disease outbreaks) will be monitored through early warning systems and indicators, including meteorological and floods forecasts and surveillance systems in coordination with relevant partners, to inform anticipatory actions.

### Response Monitoring

The humanitarian community will strengthen accountability for assistance to vulnerable people in Sudan through improved monitoring efforts by the different coordination forums. Clusters will monitor their response based on HNRP indicators to track progress towards activities (output level) and consolidate age- and gender-disaggregated inputs from partners and report to OCHA through the monthly 5Ws report on *Activityinfo* and HPC Tools. Stockpiles monitoring will also be undertaken by clusters to establish needed stocks and identify partners for stocks that are available or in the pipeline to meet the needs of the targeted population. The methodology for the calculations of people reached with inter-cluster assistance will be adjusted in 2025 to consider key indicators at locality level. The Community and Feedback Response Mechanism will be used to inform accountability to the affected population in the implementation of the response.

### Summary of Needs

Sudan’s education system is on the brink of collapse following the outbreak of the conflict in April 2023, which resulted in the loss of an entire school year, jeopardizing the future of millions of children. Of the 12.5 million children enrolled in 2023, 10.5 million have been unable to return to school, putting them at risk of permanently dropping out. This crisis disproportionately affects vulnerable groups, particularly girls, who face systemic barriers to education during conflicts. Globally, girls in conflict areas are two and a half times more likely to be out of primary school and 90 percent more likely to be out of secondary school. Being out of school not only deprives children of education, but also exposes them to heightened protection risks, including GBV and child recruitment, cutting off access to a safe and protective learning environment.

Displacement has exacerbated a dire educational situation by disrupting learning and straining the overburdened education system. About 90 per cent of displaced individuals are using schools as shelters. According to State Ministries of Education, over 3,200 schools (17 per cent of all the schools in Sudan) have been used for shelter, posing a significant barrier to accessing education for over 2.5 million internally displaced and host community children. This dual use of schools fosters tension between IDPs and host communities. IDPs respondents to the 2024 MSNA listed school reopening as one of the risks for forced eviction. In many of the same localities, host communities listed ‘school reopening’ among their top three needs for support.

Prolonged school closure and deprivation of education are associated with significant protection risks and life-threatening circumstances, such as recruitment to armed groups/forces, GBV, child labour, as well as further exclusion and vulnerability, especially for children with disabilities and adolescent girls. Field reports indicate a heightened risk of recruitment to armed groups among out-of-school adolescent boys and girls. At least 209 cases of child recruitment have been documented, while undocumented cases are expected to be much higher. Child marriage is also reported among school-aged children in at least 70 localities as per the MSNA. School-aged children in conflict zones, hard-to-reach areas, and displaced and vulnerable communities are at high risk of violence, abuse, trafficking, and exploitation. Millions of these children urgently need access to safe, protective learning environments with psychosocial support. The war has also escalated attacks on schools, including shelling, destruction, and occupation by armed groups.

### Response Strategy

The Education Cluster response will focus on supporting the most vulnerable girls and boys who have been denied access to education or are at risk of dropping out due to the ongoing crisis. The response will focus on providing learning opportunities in safe, protective environments to improve their learning, well-being, and mental health, while mitigating the severe protection risks associated with prolonged school closures. The response will prioritize urgent life-saving and immediate education needs to ensure continuity of learning for 3 million school-aged children, including those with disabilities, through formal and non-formal education. Key strategies will include protecting children from physical threats, including sexual abuse and exploitation, and from recruitment into armed groups. They will also provide mental health and psychosocial support to both children and teachers to address the trauma of conflict and displacement; ensure equitable access to education with an emphasis on addressing the unique barriers faced by girls and children with disabilities. This approach recognizes the protective benefits of access to schools and learning centres, offering a safe space that contributes to these children's overall well-being and security.

The Education Cluster response will focus on:

- Providing principled and timely life-saving assistance that promotes children’s and teachers’ well-being,
- Enabling equitable access to safe, protective and inclusive learning environment,
- Providing quality education for crisis-affected girls and boys, including children with disabilities.

The response will be adapted to the specific needs in different areas, prioritizing the most vulnerable children in hotspot areas who might be exposed to exceptionally aggravating circumstances:

- Hotspot areas: scale up non-formal education (NFE) in safe learning spaces and offer remote and eLearning opportunities to ensure learning continuity and dissemination of life-saving messages;
- Relatively safer states without school reopening: engage with government bodies and partners to expedite school reopening and work closely with the Shelter and Protection Clusters to promote alternative shelter solutions for IDPs currently sheltering in schools;
- Safe states with school reopening: focus on facilitating children’s return to reopened schools by providing learning materials, psychosocial support and other essential resources to facilitate reintegration.

Partners will prioritize restoring education services and fostering community ownership to ensure a sustainable response. Close collaboration with WASH, Protection, Food Security, Health, and Nutrition clusters will support the integrated delivery of services to children in schools and learning centres to achieve collective outcomes for children’s learning and well-being. The learning spaces will serve as a safe environment and entry points to obtain the above services.

### Targeting and Prioritization

The Education Cluster prioritizes school-aged children who have been out of school for over a year, particularly in areas classified as severity levels 3 to 5. The targeting approach considers children who are not benefiting from ongoing non-humanitarian funded programs, Vulnerable groups, including children with disabilities, adolescent girls, and those in displaced or conflict-affected communities, localities where partner presence and capacity align with the most critical needs. By tailoring interventions to the severity of local needs, the response will ensure the efficient allocation of resources to those at greatest risk.

### Cost of Response

Education as a protection tool helps mitigate protection risks, improve overall child well-being and aid recovery from the trauma of violence. The Education Cluster requires $108.1 million to deliver critical education services to vulnerable children. Additional funds will be sought to reach those in hard-to-reach areas as security and access conditions improve. Rising costs, driven by supply chain issues, factory closures, looting, and cashflow shortages, have reduced families' purchasing power further complicating efforts to restore education for children.

### Summary of Needs

Sudan faces growing shelter needs due to conflict, refugee influxes, and natural disasters. In 2025, 11.7 million people will need shelter and non-food items (NFI), an increase of 36 per cent from 2024. Key issues include inadequate shelters, with 15.22 per cent of people living in makeshift homes suffering from leakage of roofs (50 per cent), lack of privacy (24 per cent), and lack of lighting (16 per cent). Many households lack bedding (75 per cent) and kitchen sets (30 per cent). There is also an urgent need for women- and girl-friendly spaces, and solutions for 191,619 displacedfamilies using schools as shelters.

### Response Strategy

NFI kits and emergency shelter assistance will be provided either via cash or in-kind to newly displaced populations, those in protracted displacement, and households affected by floods, fires, or hosting displaced individuals. Emergency shelter assistance includes the provision of emergency shelter kits, cash for shelter or rent, and the rehabilitation of collective centres. Support for host families aims to improve living conditions of both hosts and IDPs, reducing the need for IDPs to relocate to gathering sites or IDP camps.

As a last resort, IDP sites will be established due to the increasing number of displaced people and limited host community capacity. Local authorities will identify locations, ensuring Housing, Land and Property (HLP) due diligence, inter-agency assessments, and coordination from protection partners. Site planning will adopt a settlement-area based approach, integrating emergency shelter and infrastructure. Local authorities will receive support in urban response planning, with effective coordination crucial to addressing urgent needs and enhancing community resilience.

### Targeting and Prioritization

The prioritization criteria will focus on floods, famine, and cholera-affected localities, especially those previously overlooked. The response strategy balances distribution of NFI while targeting specific population groups, with a strong emphasis on health-related sub-cluster.

At the locality level, the most urgent needs are in states with the highest levels of severity, particularly in Aj Jazirah, Blue Nile, Central Darfur, Kassala, Khartoum, North Darfur, Red Sea, Sennar, South Darfur, South Kordofan, and White Nile. These areas face critical challenges, including the absence of basic services, overcrowding, disaster risk, protection risks, and the presence of armed groups, especially in border regions. Priority groups include vulnerable populations such as female-headed households, children and adolescents, minority groups in remote areas, people with disabilities, elderly persons, victims of trafficking, and GBV survivors. Each group faces unique challenges that require urgent attention. Coordinated humanitarian action with local authorities is essential to ensure their safety, well-being, and access to services and rights. The resilience of these communities depends on timely interventions to address critical issues and ensure equitable access to basic services and rights.

### Cost of Response

The Shelter and NFI Cluster aims to assist 2.2 million people in 2025, with a funding requirement of $229.43 million.

### Summary of Needs

Sudan’s severe acute food insecurity is primarily driven by escalating conflict and massive displacements, which cause economic, social, physiological, and psychological stresses. These disruptions are compounded by a macroeconomic crisis characterized by high inflation, currency depreciation, reduced agricultural output, rising food prices and input costs. Climatic shocks, including droughts, flooding, pest infestation, and animal diseases, worsen the situation.

As a result, 25.6 million people (55 per cent of the population) are acutely food insecure, with a breakdown of 755,975 people (2 per cent) in Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Phase 5 (Catastrophe), 8.5 million people (18 per cent) in IPC 4 (Emergency), and 16.3 million people (35 per cent) in IPC 3 (Crisis). The situation will likely deteriorate further due to the restricted access to Greater Darfur and Greater Kordofan regions, as well as Khartoum, Aj Jazirah and Sennar states. Conflicts in once agriculturally productive states like Aj Jazirah and Sennar severely impact local food production, and similar trends in White Nile and Blue Nile states may hinder agricultural production.

Additionally, states like Gedaref, Kassala, Red Sea, River Nile, and Northern, which host significant numbers of displaced people, are facing heightened food insecurity. All of Sudan’s 18 states are now affected, with the conflict disrupting trade flows, supply chains, and agricultural activities, reducing production and raising prices. If the conflict persists, food insecurity will worsen in the short and long term.

### Response Strategy

The FSL Cluster’s primary objective is to address acute food insecurity and livelihood challenges among the most vulnerable populations. The cluster provides life-saving emergency food assistance and agricultural livelihood support based on the Central Emergency Response Fund (CARF) life-saving criteria tailored to Sudan’s context. The FSL Cluster’s people in need (PiN) is estimated at 25.1 million, based on the IPC Phase 3+ population (excluding refugees). Out of the PiN, the cluster aims to reach 16.5 million people. Of these, around 8.4 million people will receive emergency food assistance, and around 15.1 million will benefit from emergency agricultural livelihood support. The cluster will also consider the convergence between these two components to address extremely vulnerable populations' critical food security needs. These targets will be achieved through coordinated interventions by FSL cluster partners, which include Cluster Lead Agencies (CLAs), UN agencies, INGOs, NNGOs, and civil society organizations (CSOs), and various non-state actors working at local level, significantly contributing to the cluster’s response plan. Under the primary objective stated above, the FSL Cluster response will be implemented through provision of emergency food assistance; supporting emergency agricultural livelihoods; facilitating food security cluster coordination at national, humanitarian hubs and sub-national levels; plus conducting and consolidation of findings from emergency food security and livelihood assessments for improved evidence-based decision making and actions.

Emergency food assistance will include general food distribution through various modalities: in-kind modality and cash/voucher modality (full ration /100 per cent/, reduced ration /70 per cent/, and half-ration /50 per cent), community-led assistance \[hot meals distribution\], and food assistance for assets modality (cash/voucher 50 per cent). The emergency agricultural livelihoods response will support agriculture, livestock, fisheries, veterinary services, and social protection initiatives, prioritizing populations facing severe acute food insecurity — residents, newly displaced people, and protracted IDPs. Vulnerable farmers, agro-pastoralists, pastoralists, and fisherfolk will receive scaled-up emergency livelihood assistance through in-kind and cash/voucher-based transfer modalities.

The Cluster’s key advocacy messages will highlight the prevailing extreme acute food insecurity and livelihood impoverishment situation of a massive, unprecedented scale and scope. Strong advocacy efforts will be exerted in presenting and promoting the progress of the Cluster’s response reach portfolio and the multiple challenges being encountered in securing access to hard-to-reach areas and obtaining funding.

FSL Cluster partners will regularly collect, analyze, and disseminate updated reliable, accurate, and credible evidence and data on acute food insecurity to inform decision-makers and practitioners alike. The food insecurity information products shall highlight the significant challenges faced, including access constraints, supply chain and market disruptions, high input costs and production reductions, communication issues, and banking problems that hinder the cluster’s in-kind and cash-based response interventions.

Overall, an enhanced and sustained FSL response shall be accelerated to either halt or possibly reduce the prevailing extreme and catastrophic levels of acute food insecurity by facilitating evidence-based and coordinated cluster response at scale, mobilizing required funding resources, advocating for improved access and resources, and promoting the use of creative, innovative, flexible and nimble response approaches. Multi-sectoral convergence among core clusters (FSL, Nutrition, WASH, Health and MPCA) will be strengthened. Most importantly, protection and other cross-cutting issues will be well-mainstreamed in the response interventions.

### Targeting and Prioritization

The FSL Cluster’s geographic population and target priorities consider the severity of vulnerabilities of affected populations. The Cluster targets the population in IPC Phase 3+ and above, focusing on IPC Phase 5 and IPC Phase 4 as top priorities. Given the humanitarian imperative, substantial IPC Phase 3 populations are also considered in the targets, given that many in non-reached areas could shift into a more food insecure phase. For instance, in hard-to-reach areas such as the five Darfur states, three Kordofan states, Khartoum, Al Jazirah and Sennar states, where access is severely limited, the situation of more IPC phase 3 population could further deteriorate. In those relatively accessible states of Gedaref, Kassala, Red Sea, River Nile, Northern, Blue Nile, and White Nile, which have seen an influx of IDPs, a reasonable number of IPC Phase 3 populations will also be expected to further slide to the worse phase and hence considered in the response.

Regarding the population categories, the FSL Cluster response will prioritize the most vulnerable groups, including IDPs, host communities, and non-hosting communities in priority order. The targeting pays special attention to persons with disabilities, women (including female heads of households and pregnant and breastfeeding women), children (including child heads of households), the elderly, and others facing similar heightened risks. For livelihood support, vulnerable farmers, agro-pastoralists, pastoralists, and fisherfolks will be key targets. Household-level targeting will identify the most vulnerable individuals through assessments and analysis of food security and socio-economic conditions. The FSL Cluster operates across all 18 states with a significant presence of international and national partners on the ground.

### Cost of Response

The FSL Cluster seeks $1.5 billion to assist 16.5 million people in 2025.

### Summary of Needs

Sudan ranks among the top four countries in the world with the highest prevalence of global acute malnutrition (GAM), with pre-conflict rates of 13.6 percent. Recent SMART surveys show further deterioration in the nutrition situation, with 30 per cent of the 38 validated SMART surveys reporting GAM prevalence of 15 per cent and above the WHO emergency threshold, out of which three surveys recorded GAM of 30 per cent, which is the famine threshold. The nutrition outlook is projected to further deteriorate in 2025 due to expanding conflict, food security decline, compromised health and WASH services, and prolonged and recent displacements. As more SMART surveys continue to reveal worsening nutrition situation in many parts of the country, the 2025 projected PiN of 3.72 million - of which over 772,000 are cases of children under five years of age with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) – across the country from IDP, host and non-hosting communities is expected to be higher.

Around 77 per cent of acutely malnourished children under five years of age, pregnant and breastfeeding women reside in 137 localities with nutrition cluster severity level 4 and 5. In addition, over 33 per cent (about 1.26 million) of the total PiN live in 61 localities with the highest multi-sectoral vulnerability (severity level 4 and 5) for FSL, Health and WASH, implying high likelihood of increased prevalence of acute malnutrition being widespread to the extent never documented in Sudan before.

Apart from wasting, micronutrient malnutrition is prevalent, with 48 per cent of children under five experiencing anemia due to iron deficiency. Minimum dietary diversity among children under five is low at 25 per cent, further exacerbated by massive displacement disrupting feeding and caregiving practices. The Cluster has estimated that over 6.6 million children under five and 3.7 million pregnant and breastfeeding women or girls will need emergency humanitarian nutrition assistance throughout 2025.

Primary needs in the nutrition cluster are multi-fold, namely: (i) preventive nutrition interventions focusing on maternal and young child nutrition; (ii) early detection and treatment of acute malnutrition; (iii) Management of small and nutritionally At-risk Infants and their Mothers (MAMI); (iv) micronutrient supplementation; (v) food and non-food nutrition interventions; (vi) evidence generation through assessments and analyses; (vii) rehabilitation of nutrition infrastructure; and (viii) capacity strengthening.

### Response Strategy

The Nutrition Cluster aims to scale up preventive and treatment nutrition interventions by expanding service sites, prioritizing areas with high malnutrition rates in both host and IDP communities and areas with high intersectoral severity of needs. The Cluster will promote non-food prevention measures and strengthen cluster coordination. To ensure efficiency and intact supply pipeline of the core therapeutic and supplementary food, the procurement will be continued by lead agencies (UNICEF, WFP and WHO) for distribution as well as increasing cross-border and crossline routes and pre-positioning of supplies. In consultations with partners, the Cluster will adapt interventions and approaches recommended by the 2023 WHO guideline on Wasting Management as appropriate to the Sudan context as per guidance that will be provided.

The Cluster targets 2.3 million people representing over 62 per cent of the 3.7 million cases of malnourished children under five years and pregnant and breastfeeding women or girls in need of treatment for acute malnutrition. Over 87 per cent of the total PiN with SAM with and without complications (695,000 people) will be targeted, of which more than 101,000 people have medical complications. On the hand, over 64 per cent of the total (2.2 million) children with moderate acute malnourished children and pregnant and breastfeeding women (0.5million) will be targeted. The risk of mortality among children with SAM and moderately acute malnutrition (MAM) is 11 times and four times higher respectively compared to their well-nourished peers. For children with SAM and medical complications, nine out of 10 are likely to die if not treated.

In addition, 2.3 million children under five years and 1.9 million pregnant and breastfeeding women or girls will be targeted by nutrition services, but these figures are not included in the cluster’s PiN. Response modalities include static sites, integrated mobile teams, and cross-border response in hard-to-reach areas and integrated nutrition screening and micro-nutrient supplementation campaign. Cash transfers for recommended nutrition cluster curative and preventive interventions will also be implemented for specific groups and areas as needed and especially in locations where traditional response programming is a challenge.

### Targeting and Prioritization

Targeting is based on strict specific nutrition criteria, including individual nutrition assessments. The nutrition response for 2025 will focus on eight areas:

- Prioritizing the youngest and most vulnerable children with the highest mortality risk.
- Providing life-saving preventive and protective nutrition package.
- Implementing non-food and food-based malnutrition prevention programs.
- Treating SAM cases with medical complications.
- Treating SAM cases without medical complications among children under five years
- Supplementation of MAM children at higher risk with RUTF.
- Provision of supplementary feeding for moderately malnourished children under-fives years, pregnant and breastfeeding women, or girls.
- Generating evidence for planning, advocating for resources and decision-making.

The cluster prioritized localities based on specific criteria mainly – the GAM rate of 15 per cent and above - the WHO emergency threshold as priority one. For priority two and three, IPC AcuteFood Insecurity (IPC-AFI) and IDPs are considered. In the context of 2025 HRP prioritization, the cluster priority one localities include the 54 inter-cluster prioritized localities and 59 localities with GAM 15 per cent and above that are not part of the inter-cluster prioritization. This implies that the nutrition cluster will focus and give equal weight in terms of prioritization of response to the 113 localities targeting about 66.4 per cent of the nutrition cluster annual target (see the priority 1 localities link map). The priority localities will be updated regularly as the latest SMART surveys results are shared with all partners.

Depending on availability of resources, priority will be given to immediate lifesaving interventions especially in famine risk areas and localities with emergency and catastrophic levels of acute malnutrition.

### Cost of Response

The Cluster requires $471.66 million to implement its planned activities, with about 71 per cent of this budget allocated to addressing acute malnutrition among children under-five years and pregnant and breastfeeding women or girls. The cluster has revised the targets for the prevention interventions given the consideration of the funding projection for 2025, insecurity, high operational costs and access constraints. Part of the lifesaving preventive interventions will be funded through common UN approaches.

The protection situation in Sudan has sharply deteriorated over the past year due to expanding conflict, widespread violations of International Humanitarian Law (IHL) and International Human Rights Law (IHRL), and increasing insecurity. Areas receiving large numbers of IDPs face growing protection challenges as needs outstrip local response capacities. Weak governance, the breakdown of the rule of law and consequent impunity have fuelled unchecked protection violations, with ethnic tensions exacerbated by ongoing mobilization of civilians. People with disabilities, survivors of violence, and those experiencing family separation face additional barriers to accessing services, worsened by humanitarian access constraints, security risks affecting frontline responders and damaged facilities. There are 11.7 million people who urgently need protection services to mitigate violence risks and rebuild their lives.

### Response Strategy

Since the start of the conflict in April 2023, over 12 million civilians have been displaced due to indiscriminate attacks, forced recruitment, and sexual violence. The Protection Cluster and its Areas of Responsibility (AoRs) focus on effective protection responses through continuous monitoring, data-driven needs analysis, advocacy, and collaboration with local actors and civil society to facilitate informed community-based response activities. The Cluster addresses IHL and IHRL violations via legal aid and advocacy aligned with the HCT Protection Strategy. The Cluster emphasizes community-based approaches through ongoing capacity building for frontline responders and advocacy for flexible funding, while ensuring access to specialized services through thematic and tailored training for Cluster partners and strengthened referral pathways to health and MHPSS services.

### Targeting and Prioritization

Priority areas are identified using the Protection Cluster severity scale for localities that are experiencing acute displacement and deteriorating protection environments, as well as hotspot mapping for areas affected by prolonged conflict, or at heightened risk of inter-communal violence. A key Cluster priority is to ensure that vulnerable host community members and other affected populations with protection needs have equitable access to protection services. Prioritization also considers the protection impacts of seasonal flood risks and other factors, including displacement, loss of assets and barriers to accessing basic services. Protection activities aim to reduce vulnerability and prioritize support for those who remain vulnerable, both through direct assistance and establishing systematic identification and referral mechanisms for individuals with specific needs, while addressing barriers to accessing services and complementary support.

### Cost of Response

The cost of the planned response by Protection Cluster in 2025 is $73 million. Protection activities predominantly revolve around service provision, which can entail relatively higher costs due to the imperative for skilled personnel, sustained implementation and ongoing protection monitoring, capacity building, supervision and quality assurance. There is also a need to re-establish humanitarian service provision facilities that have been destroyed in conflict-affected areas. It should be noted that the increased outreach component envisaged for 2025, together with the expanded operationalization of multi-purpose community centres, will not only benefit the Protection Cluster response, but will also expand the access of the affected population to all sectors making use of these points for information dissemination and identification of people in need of their services.

### Summary of Needs

Over 31.4 million people, nearly half of whom are children, require humanitarian assistance in Sudan. Widespread insecurity, flooding, risk of famine, and disease outbreaks, including cholera, heighten child protection risks. Prolonged displacement and traumatic experiences are adversely affecting children's growth, development, and wellbeing. Children face abduction, sexual violence, child marriage, child labour, recruitment into armed groups, and trafficking. In 2024 alone, over 60,000 cases of abuse and exploitation were reported, with a 480 per cent increase in grave violations, making Sudan one of the highest prevelence countries for such incidents.

The conflict has displaced 5 million children, many of whom are unaccompanied due to separation from caregivers. Both boys and girls suffer from severe psychological trauma, nightmares and emotional distress. Girls face increased risks of child marriage and GBV, including sexual violence used as a weapon of war, while boys are at risk of forced recruitment and detention. Limited access to health, education, and child protection services exacerbates the crisis, as many facilities have been attacked and are under-resourced, while humanitarian staff have been affected themselves.

### Response Strategy

The Child Protection Area of Responsibility will be guided by the following Sectoral Objectives (SO) using a socio-ecological approach consistent with child protection minimum standards (CPMS).

**SO1:** The needs of highly vulnerable children and their caregivers are addressed through well-coordinated, specialized child protection response strategies, including comprehensive case management services to children at risk of separation, violence, neglect and abuse.

**SO2:** Child Protection risks are mitigated by working across sectors for more holistic child protection and enhancing the protective environment among children, families, and communities through prevention and risk mitigation methods, including addressing negative social norms.

**SO3:** The overall well-being and safeguarding environment for girls and boys is enhanced through multi-layered mental health and psychosocial support, family strengthening and community-level strategies, and inter-agency coordination to promote effective situation and response monitoring, localization, and advocacy.

Priorities for strengthening quality child protection interventions include:

- Supporting individual children in vulnerable situations and their caregivers through quality child protection case management, including focused MHPSS, family tracing and reunification, alternative care, inter-agency standard operating procedures and ethical information management for case management to strengthen the implementation of CPIMS+, and referrals to other service providers.
- Enhancing the family and caregiving environment through positive parenting support and MHPSS for caregivers.
- Strengthening community-level strategies by improving support for community groups/networks addressing harmful social norms and identifying risks, facilitating safe case referrals, developing risk mitigation strategies, and providing psychological first aid to children and their families.
- Expanding localized, high-quality services through inter-agency coordination and collaboration, including capacity building for child protection personnel, local social service workers, civil society, local authorities, and other relevant sectors, to increase access to safer, more comprehensive services for children. Areas of focus include training and coaching on child protection response strategies per the CPMS, child safeguarding, and child protection mainstreaming and integration along with supporting the harmonization of incentive systems and job descriptions.
- Strengthening Information Management Systems, including the Monitoring and Reporting Mechanisms (MRM+), and child protection situation and response monitoring systems.

### Targeting and Prioritization

The Child Protection AoR, in consultation with sub-national coordinators, Government and non-government organizations, and based on the 2024 MSNA, DTM, Hotspot Analysis, MRM and the Child Protection Information Management System, considered access constraints and dynamic conditions in developing the targeting and prioritization strategy.

The following priorities have been identified:

- Focus on commonly underserved internally displaced children across all five severity levels (100 per cent).
- Allocate resources to 50 per cent of children in hosting communities and 30 per cent in non-hosting communities, specifically targeting localities with severity levels 3 and above.
- Effectively address critical needs in hard-to-reach areas experiencing high severity and reported violations of IHL.

### Cost of Response

To support 3.1 million children, the CP AoR seeks $90.63 million. Priorities include specialized services for vulnerable children facing separation, violence, exploitation, and abuse, alongside strengthening community-based structures to address child protection risks.

### Summary of Needs

Over 12.2 million women and girls, and increasingly men and boys, are at risk of GBV across Sudan; this is 80 per cent higher than the previous year. There has been a marked increase in incidents of conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV), including rape and kidnapping, as well as intimate partner violence, child marriage, and survival sex. GBV survivors face severe physical and mental health consequences, with older women, adolescent girls, and women and girls with disabilities at heightened risk. Whilst comprehensive data on the number of survivors who have disclosed the violence is not available, there has been a 400 per cent increase in the provision of GBV specialized services. This includes case management, psychosocial support, health services and legal advice.

Despite the increase in the provision of comprehensive lifesaving GBV response services, this reflects less than 1 per cent of those at risk; with a significant portion of the population unable to safely access GBV response services, due to (i) limited humanitarian access in conflict-affected states, (ii) shortage of supplies, and (iii) limited availability of specialized GBV services. Access to services in many affected localities is severely curtailed by insecurity, widespread damage to assets and property, and looting of medical supplies and facilities, including health centres and hospitals. These challenges hinder the ability of GBV services to meet significantly increasing needs.

### Response Strategy

In 2025, the GBV AoR’s priority activities will contribute to achieving the following objectives:

- Increase access to quality lifesaving GBV response services, including clinical management of rape, case management, and psychosocial support, and strengthen referral pathways.
- Promote and support GBV risk mitigation into all aspects of the humanitarian response.
- Identify and address the barriers facing survivors and those at risk of GBV in accessing GBV response services.

The response will target the most vulnerable women, adolescent girls and groups, including those living with disabilities and survivors of SEA among the displaced, returnees and host-community settings in the prioritized locations.

### Targeting and Prioritization

GBV AoR interventions will target populations living in areas with severe risks of GBV and significant gaps in quality multi-sectoral response services. Women and girls who are disproportionately affected by GBV will be the main target for GBV response services, with community mobilization targeting the wider community. Persons living with disabilities, adolescent girls, female heads of households and other vulnerable groups will be prioritized for support. To achieve a robust GBV response and prevention environment, the AoR priorities for 2025 will be guided by the inter-agency GBV minimum standards as well as survivor centred, human rights and community-based approaches.

### Cost of Response

To reach the GBV AoR target of 3.2 million people, the AoR requires $88.54 million. The plan includes doubling the number of partners; increasing GBV response services; and expanding Women and Girls Safe Spaces (WGSS) via static and mobile platforms. Additionally, the AoR will advocate for more integrated services to improve the efficiency of the response.

### Summary of Needs

Extensive use of explosive weapons has been reported since the outbreak of the conflict in April 2023, which has caused more than 20,000 reported fatalities and thousands of injuries and left the country with a new and extensive layer of Explosive Ordnance (EO) contamination. This is in addition to 34 sq km of legacy EO contamination that remainedfrom previous conflicts over the past decades. These hazards are spread across wide areas of the country, including urban centres, such as Khartoum, and in rural areas. Civilians face the immediate risk of injury and death caused by these hazards, with exact figures unknown due to reporting limitations, but with expectations of large increases in accidents as the conflict continues and as displaced populations move across or return to conflict-affected areas. Beyond this immediate risk, EOs are found along roads, airstrips, schools, medical facilities, and other critical infrastructure. Their presence prevents civilians from having safe access to these services and affects the ability of humanitarian workers to deliver aid in conflict-affected areas safely, exacerbating vulnerabilities. Given the widespread nature of the explosive hazard threat and its wide-reaching impacts, more than 13 million civilians nationwide need mine action support in Sudan.

### Response Strategy

MA-AoR will reinforce the sub-cluster’s capacities to provide comprehensive mine action interventions to EO-affected communities and displaced populations at risk, focusing on the following key areas:

1. Deliver lifesaving, age- and gender-tailored Explosive Ordnance Risk Education (EORE) to vulnerable populations, including IDPs, at risk of explosive hazards.
2. Survey and clear explosive hazards in areas affected by the conflict to enable safe population movements, safe delivery of humanitarian aid, and support future recovery efforts.
3. Support the effective coordination of the sector, including through advocacy, data collection, information management, and provision of technical advice for humanitarians, in support of a principled, prioritized approach to humanitarian mine action operations.
4. Support national and sub-national stakeholders to facilitate the implementation of mine action operations within Sudan.
5. Provide victim assistance support to survivors of explosive hazard incidents.

The MA-AoR response will prioritize raising awareness about EO risks and promoting safe behaviour among over 350,000 at-risk people, including IDPs, host communities, and social workers, through direct sessions, messages that will be amplified through indirect risk education methods, including community volunteers, use of radio, TV, social media and integration of messaging throughout the broader response, to reach millions more with these core safety messages. Additionally, more than 2.6 million people, including residents, IDPs, and returnees, will gain safer access to services, housing, and infrastructures through surveys and clearance of explosive hazards.

The response will also include technical analysis and advice to humanitarian operators regarding explosive hazard threats in their operational areas. Furthermore, at least 700 survivors of explosive hazards will receive comprehensive support, including medical care, psychological support, rehabilitation services, socio-economic reintegration, service mapping, and assessment of referral pathways.

### Targeting and Prioritization

Despite the widespread impact of EO, which has affected 188 localities across the country, mine action efforts will prioritize areas newly affected by EO due to the ongoing conflict, especially urban areas with high civilian populations and those experiencing heightened movement among IDPs and returnees. Awareness campaigns will target people living in localities impacted by conflict as well as IDPs who have fled conflict areas. Explosive hazard survey and clearance efforts will focus on roads, medical facilities, schools, humanitarian facilities, and other critical infrastructure. The gendered impact of the conflict and EO will be considered when community needs are assessed, including by collecting sex and age-disaggregated data to ensure women’s representation and participation in defining specific targets and priorities. Through gendered analysis of the local context, the response approach will be adapted to address gendered mine action needs, and women’s empowerment will be integrated into specific interventions.

### Cost of Response

The total cost of the mine action response is $23.5 million, covering EORE, survey, and clearance of EO while enhancing the quality of delivery, coordination efforts, and victim assistance support.

### Summary of Needs

Sudan has over 11.5 million IDPs (as of 10 December 2024, with 44 per cent of them living in camps, informal settlements, and collective centres. Cluster assessments confirm that IDP sites across Sudan’s 18 states are overcrowded and lack basic services, creating precarious living conditions. In White Nile State, Cluster intention surveys conducted in April 2024 revealed that 86 per cent of the displaced people intend to remain in a place of displacement, primarily due to safety, security, and proximity to services where available. Similarly, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM)and surveys show that 62 per cent of IDPs countrywide are likely to stay in the place of displacement due to better security and family connections or extended support networks. With ongoing displacements and the decreasing capacity of host communities, the number of IDP sites is expected to grow and in 2025, 4.7 million IDPs will need site management support.

### Response Strategy

The Cluster will prioritize meeting the critical needs of millions of people in sites and site-like settings, focusing on three key objectives:

- Strengthening access to multi-sectoral services through a protection-centred approach,
- Enhance community resilience through participation and engagement, including the meaningful participation of women on site planning and decision-making, and
- Improve site protection through small-scale improvements and addressing protection gaps.

Protection risks, including GBV, will be mitigated and regularly assessed. Site demographics will be mapped to ensure assistance reaches the most vulnerable. Coordination will be enhanced using site management tools and community consultations to build local capacity and ensure services meet minimum standards.

### Targeting and Prioritization

The prioritization and targeting process will be based on sectoral severity analysis, focusing on areas with high vulnerability, specifically those classified as severity levels 5, 4, and 3 . Considering the dynamic situation, access constraints, climate-induced disasters like flash floods, growing food insecurity, and limited resources, the Cluster will prioritize the sites that host a significant number of IDPs for site management interventions to ensure safe and dignified living conditions.

### Cost of Response

The Cluster seeks an overall financial requirement of $15.92 million to meet the above strategic objectives in 2025. The Cluster will build on the gains made in the 2024 response and leverage its partner presence and expertise in site management, community expertise, and stakeholder engagements at the national and state levels.

### Summary of Needs

Before the conflict, around 11 million Sudanese people lacked access to basic water services, with 26 per cent of the water supply systems non-functional. The situation has since deteriorated significantly, leading many people to rely on unsafe and unprotected surface water. The sharp rise in fuel costs and unavailability of fuel supplies have rendered fuel-reliant community water yards non-functional and difficult to maintain. Some urban water schemes have either been destroyed by war or poorly maintained, resulting in a lack of revenue generation. The responsibility of maintaining the remaining functional systems, including providing water treatment chemicals and implementing quick fixes to prevent public health catastrophes, has largely fallen mainly to humanitarian actors. In rural areas, functioning hand pumps and protected water wells remain critical sources of improved water.

Sudan had one of the worst sanitation conditions in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region even before the crisis, with about 27 million people (63.6 per cent) lacking access to basic sanitation services. Among these, 10.3 million people (23 per cent) defecate in the open, which poses significant health risks and exacerbates GBV concerns, particularly for women and girls as they become victims of GBV while going far trying to find privacy. The situation remains challenging as the emergency sanitation responses are temporary with the aim to mitigate the immediate public health risks.

The displaced population and other vulnerable groups rely on the humanitarian community for essential hygiene items, including soap and critical WASH supplies such as menstrual hygiene products for women of reproductive age. The increasing concentration of newly displaced people is straining already limited WASH resources, contributing to life-threatening cholera outbreaks and other diarrheal diseases, which exacerbate malnutrition rates.

Currently, there are 12 million IDPs in Sudan, many of whom are living with host communities or in government-identified locations. Additionally, thousands of self-identified gathering points, including schools, complicate the delivery of essential services. Furthermore, 46 per cent of Sudanese schools lack access to drinking water, 71 per cent lack handwashing facilities, and there is an average of 132 students per latrine. More than half of health and nutrition facilities lack basic water and sanitation services.

### Response Strategy

The WASH response will focus on areas with large concentrations of people, ongoing disease outbreaks, hotspots, areas at risk of famine, high GAM rates, and especially areas where WASH coverage is poor. It will prioritize localities affected by natural disasters such as floods and drought. WASH will continue to collaborate and support health, education, and protection facilities where public health risks are high. Cluster partners plan to target around 10.1 million people with emergency basic water services, 2.4 million with gender-sensitive sanitation services shared by households, communal, and household emergency sanitation, and 9.1 million with hygiene promotion and hygiene supplies to promote hand washing with soap in emergency settings. These targets are divided between urban and rural areas. WASH Cluster response will focus on the following priorities:

- Maintain existing WASH services in urban, rural areas, including IDP gathering points. This includes supporting the running of urban water supply systems, operation, maintenance, quick repairs and rehabilitation, water treatment and shared communal and institutional latrines.
- Install new cost-effective emergency facilities and services. This involves installing handpumps, wells, water yards, shared emergency household and communal latrines, handwashing facilities, and hygiene promotion activities. Water trucking is to be introduced and supported where no other options exist (as it is expensive in the long run to sustain).
- Provision of WASH supplies. This is essential for bulk and household water supply and treatment in urban and rural cholera-risk localities; maintaining and improving hygiene practices at all levels, including supplies for vector control, solid waste disposal, and management, which will be important in IDP gathering points and densely populated areas.

WASH cluster will continue to integrate response with other clusters, such as health, nutrition, food security, protection, education, and shelter/NFI, to address interlinked issues. Other key programmatic priorities will include emergency preparedness, prepositioning supplies, public health support, strengthening supply chains, and improving technical and management capabilities. Support for innovative approaches like solar-powered water sources is critical, mainly when access to fuel for power generation is limited. Collaboration and coordination with communities, local institutions, entrepreneurs, and the cluster will be vital, while cash-based assistance will also be considered where appropriate.

### Targeting and Prioritization

WASH interventions aim to assist 12.3 million people, including people with disabilities and the elderly. Children comprise 60 per cent of the targeted population. WASH partners prioritize addressing the critical needs of IDPs, who are 60 per cent of the cluster’s People in Need (PiN), while 45 per cent of the host communities and 42 per cent of the non-host population are included in the PiN. Vulnerable groups among these three categories are from localities with the highest severity levels—classified as severe, critical/extreme, and catastrophic (3, 4, and 5).

For water needs, the response includes people who rely on surface water (severity level 5) or unsafe water sources (level 4). For sanitation, considerations include rampant open defecation (level 5), unimproved sanitation (level 4), and poor access to handwashing with soap and water (levels 4 and 5). Vulnerable populations are also prioritized in areas prone to cholera and acute watery diarrhea (AWD) outbreaks, flooding, famine-affected areas, and individuals facing multiple vulnerabilities, particularly malnutrition.

### Cost of Response

The cluster requires $301 million for the response, including maintaining standard core supply pipelines. The significant shift in operating costs can primarily be attributed to increased expenses for transportation, WASH supplies, fuel, the operation of water supply services (systems/stations and public water facilities) and installation of emergency WASH facilities and services in locations where access and security challenges persist.

### Summary of Needs

The CCS Cluster ensures humanitarian response is effectively coordinated, inclusive, and grounded in solid data. Amid the urgent need for scaling up humanitarian response, CCS is committed to facilitating the timely exchange of information, conducting thorough needs analysis, and advocating for affected populations. The key priorities for CCS include strengthening coordination mechanisms to effectively scale up the famine response, conducting comprehensive multi-sectoral needs assessments to fill the information gaps and assess the humanitarian needs of the population on a granular level, and utilizing the DTM mechanism to provide accurate and reliable data regularly. Additionally, ensuring the safety and security of humanitarian workers remains a top priority as the crisis continues to evolve.

### Response Strategy

The CCS cluster facilitates humanitarian operations through:

- Data-driven decision-making, including collecting and disseminating DTM up-to-date data for accurate population tracking, monitoring of displacement and returns to provide a better understanding of the population movements and their evolving needs, and conduct multi-sectoral needs assessments to inform and guide strategic response.
- Coordination of humanitarian response, including leading inter-cluster coordination to streamline operations, supporting leadership in strategic decision-making, and establishing coordination hubs closer to people in need to enhance the speed and efficiency of the response.
- Advocacy for affected populations, including coordinating humanitarian public information campaigns, engaging in negotiations with conflict parties to ensure the protection of civilians, and securing humanitarian access.
- Enhancing access and security, including deploying security personnel to support humanitarian operations, strengthening crisis preparedness, civil-military coordination, access negotiation capacity, and enhancing the security management capacity of UNDSS to foster safe operational environments.

### Targeting and Prioritization

As the conflict continues, the need for strengthening and establishing new humanitarian hubs closer to affected populations is becoming increasingly critical. The urgency of consent for cross-border supply delivery has intensified, while enhanced civil-military coordination alongside strengthened access negotiation capabilities are essential for improving and scaling up operations. Internal displacement continues to rise, necessitating continuous assessments and contingency planning. Additionally, under the famine response plan, targeting and prioritization have become central, focusing on identifying the most vulnerable populations and directing scarce resources to those in greatest need. These targeting mechanisms are more data-driven, incorporating displacement trends, conflict severity, and food insecurity levels to ensure a more effective and prioritized response.

### Cost of Response

CCS Cluster seeks $29.44 million to strengthen coordination services; monitor and track population mobility, including IDPs and returnees; spearhead advocacy for affected populations and sustain comprehensive needs assessments. It also includes the cost of scaling up critical security support for the existing and new humanitarian response hubs, security risk assessments, and route planning to facilitate safe programme delivery.

### Summary of Needs

Since the outbreak of the conflict in Sudan in April 2023, damaged telecommunications have disrupted the lives of millions of people and significantly hindered aid efforts. The ETC Cluster seeks to urgently restore communications in the most affected regions, including Khartoum, Darfur, and Kordofan, enabling faster and more coordinated delivery of humanitarian aid. Furthermore, the plan emphasises the importance of engaging local communities to ensure long-term sustainability and exit strategy after the ETC is de-activated.

The ETC’s planned response will require approximately $14 million, including funding for staff salaries, equipment, and the establishment of Security Operations Centres (SOCs). Immediate funding is critical to support life-saving efforts.

### Response Strategy

ETC will implement a comprehensive response to support humanitarian efforts in Sudan across four key pillars - coordination and information management; security communications; data connectivity; and community services. The cluster will facilitate effective humanitarian aid delivery through enhanced coordination mechanisms and robust information management systems – convening regular coordination meetings with relevant stakeholders and developing a range of information management products to track progress, identify gaps, and make data-driven decisions.

ETC will deploy and maintain critical security communications infrastructure, including VHF/HF radios and satellite phones, supported by SOC staff. Data connectivity services will be established at key operational sites, complemented by helpdesk support and technical training. Through its Services for Communities initiative, the cluster will also work to establish communication platforms for affected populations, implement feedback mechanisms, and build local capacity for long-term sustainability. ETC will maintain flexibility to adapt to changing security conditions, while emphasizing community involvement and sustainable solutions throughout its operations.

### Targeting and Prioritization

The ETC Cluster will prioritize support for Khartoum, Darfur, and Kordofan where damaged infrastructure and communication failures have severely hindered humanitarian efforts. Restoring services in these regions is critical to ensuring effective aid delivery. Prioritization will be coordinated through inter-agency mechanisms such as the ICCG and HCT, using real-time data to guide decisions. The ETC Cluster will remain flexible to adapt its approach as conditions evolve.

### Cost of Response

The Emergency Telecommunications Cluster requires $13.89 million to implement its telecommunications restoration and sustainability plan across Sudan. This funding will cover key expenses, including the procurement of VHF and HF radios, satellite phones, and data connectivity equipment, along with the installation and deployment of communications infrastructure in conflict-affected areas such as Khartoum, Darfur, and Kordofan. Additionally, the budget will support staffing and salaries, recurring costs, contractual services, and indirect support expenses.

The $13.89 million budget is deemed essential to restore telecommunications infrastructure in conflict-affected areas of Sudan, where services have been devastated. This funding will provide critical connectivity to the humanitarian community’s collective efforts to provide support to over 10 million people, including through facilitating cash-based transfers by enabling retailer networks to access communication services for digital transactions. To ensure long-term sustainability, local staff will be trained to manage these systems once ETC’s activation period ends. Immediate funding is crucial to avoid delays in rebuilding these vital networks. To best facilitate effective use of resources and handling of procurements, it will be important for available funding to be received in larger, regular tranches. This will allow ETC to make bulk purchase orders when needed and better manage long lead times resulting from manufacturing, logistical, and bureaucratic processes.

### Summary of Needs

Widespread insecurity and conflict dynamics have significantly impacted physical access to key locations, disrupted supply chain capacities, damaged infrastructure, increased costs, and decreased the availability of commercial transportation services.

Movement restrictions, contrained humanitarian access within conflict-affected areas, complex deconfliction processes, and telecommunications outages are limiting the ability of humanitarian organizations to operate and are impeding the delivery of humanitarian assistance to affected populations. Partners have reported the following logistics gaps and bottlenecks affecting their operations:

- Limited operational points of entry into Sudan and limitations on crossline movements,
- Limited ability to contract transportation and storage services due to the unpredictability of the security situation and rising costs,
- Limited information on the availability and capacity of logistics service providers, as well as the physical status of the road network,
- Complex and lengthy customs procedures,
- Multiple bureaucratic and administrative impediments affecting cargo movements and personnel.

With Sudan's airspace largely closed, except for Port Sudan, s and requiring prior permission for humanitarian and evacuation flights for other internal locations, the UN Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS) has established regular air transport services both to and within Sudan. These services provide the humanitarian community with reliable access to key hubs, enabling the implementation of critical humanitarian programmes.

### Response Strategy

The Sudan Logistics Cluster operation will continue supporting humanitarian access to hard-to-reach locations in Sudan by providing partners with logistics information management and coordination support via two coordination cells located in Port Sudan, Sudan and N’Djamena, Chad, and through regular coordination with the South Sudan Logistics Cluster operation. Relevant information will be consolidated, analyzed, and shared regarding customs processes, logistics resources, the status of entry points, road transport routes, shared storage capacities, logistics-related standard operating procedures (SOPs), and access constraints through multiple communication streams, including the Sudan Logistics Cluster webpage, Sudan and Chad Logistics Capacity Assessments (LCAs), Logistics Information Exchange ([LogIE](https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flogie.logcluster.org%2F%3Fop%3Dsdn-23-a&data=05%7C02%7Cgilles.cimetiere%40wfp.org%7C23e59f9e33e2481c2cc408dc8ab95ff3%7C462ad9aed7d94206b87471b1e079776f%7C0%7C0%7C638537776801857098%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=Bese%2FoWI3G3B%2FUXUwliDYJuVGfLx7L%2F5QKY%2BLte1OyM%3D&reserved=0)), an email mailing list, and WhatsApp groups.

The Logistics Cluster will continue to augment partners’ storage capacity through free-to-user common storage services in strategic locations (Port Sudan, Gedaref, Kassala and Kosti), and through the loan of mobile storage units (MSUs) managed by partners in locations where the Logistics Cluster is not present. Based on a partner-driven strategy and needs, the Logistics Cluster will support partners’ cargo transshipments and augment storage capacity in strategic hubs locations such as in Al Dabbah and Kosti. In addition to the current Logistics Cluster set-up in Sudan, the hubs in Al Dabbah and Kosti will support partners’ response operations in the Darfur and Kordofan regions.

Based on critical identified road transport gaps, the Logistics Cluster will support access to in-country common road transport services to critical locations in Sudan, assisting partners to reach affected populations (access and security permitting).

Additionally, to expand operational reach into hard-to-access areas, the Logistics Cluster will continue to facilitate the coordination of inter-agency crossline supply movements in collaboration with the OCHA Civil-Military Coordination Cell. The Logistics Cluster will collect and track partners’ transportation plans against actual movements and share key information to improve visibility and advocate for enhanced access to critical locations.

WFP will continue operating UNHAS to facilitate the transport of humanitarian workers and light humanitarian cargo. This includes establishing hubs near affected populations and ensuring reliable access for humanitarian personnel using a mixed fleet of fixed-wing and rotary aircraft. UNHAS will operate, as required, international and domestic flights, adapting to current operational constraints. With 141 registered user organizations, UNHAS Sudan aims to transport 12,000 passengers and 36 metric tons of light humanitarian cargo in 2025.

### Targeting and Prioritization

The Logistics Cluster and UNHAS’ activities are aligned with HNRP priorities, partner locations, common logistics needs, gaps, and security constraints. UNHAS flights will ensure reliable access to hubs and remote field sites and maintain close communication with authorities in support of access negotiations. It will collaborate with the UN Department of Safety and Security (UNDSS), and work with key stakeholders to facilitate the safe and gradual resumption of flights to the most hard-to-reach areas as soon as possible.

### Cost of Response

The Logistics Cluster seeks `$$3.6 million and UNHAS seeks $79.9 million, with a total of $83.54 million in financial requirements for 2025. The Logistics Cluster will prioritize coordination and information management activities, alongside the provision of various common logistics services. UNHAS operational costs will depend on aircraft deployment timing and insurance premiums to include war-risk coverage, with 42 per cent estimated to cover aircraft insurance premiums.

### Summary of Needs

The ongoing conflict and annual heavy rains and flooding continue to have devasting impacts on the 892,161 refugees and asylum seekers in Sudan, who face a multitude of protection needs and are reliant on humanitarian assistance for survival. An estimated 68 per cent of all refugees live in overcrowded camps, with temporary shelters and security restrictions in place. The needs in these camps are immense and include access to safe water and sanitation facilities, shelter and NFI, health and nutrition, and education. Protection risks facing refugees and asylum seekers include arbitrary arrest and detention, forced recruitment, CRSV, risk of smuggling and trafficking. Further, refugees and asylum seekers are also faced with increasing food insecurity, disease outbreaks, malnutrition, and high mortality rates.

### Response Strategy

The 2025 Sudan Country Refugee Response Plan (CRRP), developed in coordination with the Government of Sudan Commissioner for Refugees and 34 implementing partners, is a multi-sectoral inter-agency plan that guides the refugee response in Sudan. It aims to address the needs of refugees and deliver critical protection and life-saving services, including protection, WASH, Shelter/NFI, FSL, health and nutrition, and education, to 93 localities across Sudan. The CRRP has three strategic objectives:

- Strengthen the protection environment for refugees and asylum seekers
- Enable access to timely protection interventions and lifesaving assistance
- Provide equitable access to basic services while, in parallel, strengthening opportunities for resilience and self-reliance where possible.

### Targeting and Prioritization

Refugees living in camps, who make up 68 per cent of the refugee population in Sudan, will be prioritized for the delivery of critical protection and multi-sectoral assistance, including protection (general protection, child protection, and GBV), education, FSL, health and nutrition, shelter and NFIs, and WASH assistance. Where access allows, refugees stayin out of camps will also be targeted, using community-based approaches, focusing on ensuring protection and delivering life-saving assistance.

### Cost of Response

The cost of the 2025 refugee response, through the provision of critical protection and life-saving assistance to refugees and asylum seekers in Sudan by 34 partners, is $633 million.

## 5.1 Abyei Response Plan

### Summary of Needs

The Abyei Administrative Area remains a disputed territory between Sudan and South Sudan. It faces humanitarian challenges rooted in episodic inter-communal violence, climate shocks, and chronic poverty. In addition to the perennial tensions between the Misseriya and the Dinka ethnic groups over land rights, an internal rift among the Dinka pits Dinka Ngok against the Dinka Twic tribes. Since February 2022, armed youth militia groups have emerged on both sides and criminal activities are on the rise. Both state and non-state armed actors pose an access constraint to humanitarian operations.

Since the outbreak of the conflict in Sudan in April 2023, Abyei has received nearly 25,000 people displaced from Sudan. They include South Sudanese returnees, refugees/asylum seekers, and third-country nationals. The population in the north of Abyei area has increased by about 20,000 people. The trading hub of Amiet Market has expanded, and its population has risen to nearly 40,000 people. Since 2022, inter-communal violence in the south has increased the concentration of IDPs in central Abyei (to more than 30,000 people). The Agok area has been depopulated, while Abyei town is surrounded by a large IDP settlement. In 2024, insecurity in Sudan impeded the seasonal reverse migration of herders from Abyei towards the north. This led to a settlement-like prolonged stay of about 1,400 households (about 9,800 people) of Misseriya cattle herders in Abyei.

Humanitarian needs in Abyei are the consequences of violence, impacts of natural disasters (especially heavy rains and floods), disease outbreaks, food insecurity due to loss of livelihoods, poverty, and lack of access to essential services. More than 200,000 people are currently in IPC 4. Economic hardship, high inflation rates in Sudan and South Sudan, and the inability of the local authorities to provide basic social services exacerbate the situation. In 2025, an estimated 300,000 people will require humanitarian assistance in Abyei. They include residents, IDPs, returnees and refugees from Sudan. Overall, the humanitarian response will target 250,000 people. Due to operational constraints, vulnerable people in the northern part of Abyei have not received consistent life-saving assistance since the outbreak of the Sudan conflict.

### Response Strategy

The humanitarian response will focus on:

- Strengthening emergency preparedness across all sectors.
- Providing timely multi-sectoral life-saving assistance to crisis-affected and the most vulnerable people.
- Improvement in humanitarian access; complementarities between the humanitarian response, development and peace efforts; and
- Innovative approaches in determining the priorities and context-specific solutions to the needs of communities.

The humanitarian response in Abyei is driven by a ‘whole of Abyei’ approach, drawing on the collaboration of partners based in both Sudan and South Sudan. They will leverage their comparative advantages to balance assistance in both the north and the south of Abyei. Close collaboration with development partners and peacebuilding partners is essential to creating the conditions of community resilience.

### Targeting and Prioritization

In Abyei, 24 humanitarian organizations are involved in the response, including 7 UN agencies, 5 INGOs, and 12 national NGOs. Due to operational and access constraints, people in the northern part have not received consistent life-saving assistance despite an intense community demand for an inclusive humanitarian response.

Core preparedness and response activities will focus on conducting timely needs assessments to expedite humanitarian assistance, strengthening early warning systems and risk analysis capabilities, developing contingency plans, linking humanitarian assistance with resilience-building efforts, and optimizing the humanitarian response to maximize impact with limited resources. Additionally, enabling activities will encompass ongoing negotiations for humanitarian access, fostering strategic partnership and collaboration with the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA), managing information to bolster advocacy efforts in Abyei, prioritization of cash as a modality for humanitarian assistance where feasible, and engaging with communities to ensure that the response aligns with the priorities of those affected.
