## 2. DOS Humanitarian Operations

### 2.1. Sudan Humanitarian Response

- **Current Situation:** The humanitarian crisis in Sudan is one of the most severe in the world, characterized by mass displacement, a collapsed healthcare system, widespread famine, and significant human rights violations.
- **U.S. Response:** The United States is the largest single donor to the Sudan humanitarian response, contributing over $2.3 billion. The U.S. response is coordinated through the United Nations Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP).
- **Key Challenges:** The primary challenges in the Sudan response include gaining safe and unhindered access to conflict-affected populations, securing adequate funding for the humanitarian response, ensuring effective coordination among a wide range of actors, and addressing the pervasive protection risks, particularly for women and children.
- **East Africa Regional Coordination:** The crisis has significant regional implications, with millions of refugees fleeing to neighboring countries. The response, therefore, requires robust regional coordination, with the IOM and other agencies working to address the needs of refugees and host communities across the region.

### 2.2. DOS/USAID Priorities in Sudan

- **Life-saving Assistance:** The immediate priority is to provide life-saving assistance, including food, water, shelter, and medical care, to the most vulnerable populations.
- **Protection:** There is a strong emphasis on protection activities, including preventing and responding to gender-based violence, protecting children, and ensuring the safety of humanitarian workers.
- **Support for Local Partners:** The U.S. government is increasingly focused on supporting local partners and building their capacity to respond to the crisis.
