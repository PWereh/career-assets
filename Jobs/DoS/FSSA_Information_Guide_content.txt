Introduction 2   \n2. The Foreign Service Selection Process 3   \n3. The Specialist Assessment Process 4   \n4. Sample Specialist Assessment Materials 14  \n\nIntroduction  \n\nNote: This guide covers all Foreign Service Specialist (FSS) career tracks except for the four Diplomatic Security positions:  Special Agent, Diplomatic Courier, Security Technical Specialist, and Security Engineering Officer.  \n\nThe purpose of this guide is to help familiarize candidates with the selection process so they will be able to better focus on their own performance during the Assessment rather than spend their limited time reviewing procedures.  While the main elements of the Foreign Service Specialist Assessment (FSSA) remain constant, information on details – for example, time limits or assessment order – can change quickly.  Candidates should stay alert and follow the instructions provided on the day of the assessment.  \n\nThis guide explains the criteria used to evaluate candidates, describes the activities during the FSSA, and offers some strategies candidates might consider to ensure they perform their best.  It also includes sample test materials that provide candidates with an idea of the kind of information and exercises candidates in specialist career tracks can expect during the assessment.  The guide does not include the actual materials used on the assessment day.  \n\nThe specialist career tracks fall into eight major categories: administration, construction engineering, facility management, information technology, international information and English language programs, medical and health, office management, and law enforcement and security. Not every specialist category uses exactly the same FSSA format, so please pay attention to the instructions given to you during the various exercises on the day of your FSSA.  \n\nThis guide is for the FSSA only – other guides are available for Foreign  \n\nService Officer candidates, such as the Foreign Service Officer Test (FSOT) Information Guide, the Foreign Service Officer Assessment (FSOA) Information Guide, and the Foreign Service Consular Professional Assessment FSCPA) Information Guide.  Candidates should visit  \n\ncareers.state.gov for general information on a Foreign Service Specialist career, as well as information on Foreign Service Officer careers, Civil Service careers, professional fellowship opportunities, Limited Non-Career Appointments, and student/intern programs.  \n\nThe Foreign Service Selection Process  \n\nThe Foreign Service assessment process, including the Qualifications Evaluation Panel (QEP) and the assessment itself, is an employment selection tool used by the Department of State to identify the most qualified candidates for Foreign Service positions.  In other words, it is a hiring process.  Therefore, the nature and purpose of the assessment process are different from those of educational testing.  \n\nIn education, assessment focuses on “mastery testing” and the goal is to determine if the student possesses sufficient knowledge or skill to pass a course.  The assessments are usually comprehensive, covering the entire body of required knowledge or skill.  The scores verify current competence and command of a definite skill set.  Such assessments are often accompanied by extensive feedback, and possibly remedial training and reassessment, with the ultimate objective of passing.  \n\nIn employment selection, the goal is to determine which candidates are the most qualified because an organization wants to hire the best.  These assessments only sample job-related knowledge or skills because assessment time is limited.  The scores are predictors of future job performance, rather than indicators of current competence.  Thus, tests like the FSSA are not accompanied by extensive feedback or remedial training because they are not meant to measure an entire body of knowledge or skills.  Moreover, the organization’s hiring process is meant to be highly selective given the limited number of openings available.  \n\nThe Foreign Service selection process can be a lengthy one, due primarily to the requirement that all candidates undergo a thorough background investigation to determine whether they can be granted a Top Secret security clearance and pass a suitability review.  \n\nThe Specialist Assessment Process  \n\nBefore the Assessment  \n\nForeign Service Specialist Assessments (FSSAs) are held virtually, with assessors based in Washington, D.C. and subject matter experts participating from around the world.  Candidates can participate from nearly any location of their choosing, although some rules apply.  \n\n•  Be rested.  Candidates who are tired are not at their best – taking the FSSA can be a stressful experience, and candidates need to be alert and focused at all times during the assessment.  \n\nTest your system in advance.  Check your connection speeds,   \ncamera, audio, and lighting.   \nPlan to take the assessment from a quiet room on a computer or laptop with access to the internet.  Note that tablets, iPads, or phones will not work for the FSSA.   \nYour computer or laptop should be equipped with a webcam and microphone.  Both internal and external webcams and microphones will work.  \n\n•  Please have on hand a paper and pen and government-issued photo  \n\nID.  \n\n•  The FSSA is a job interview; candidates generally wear professional attire.  \n\nThe test day is tightly choreographed, so it is essential to be on time and in the right place.  You will receive detailed instructions for using the online platform and other technical details in advance of the assessment.  \n\nThe Department of State provides provisions known as reasonable accommodations to candidates with disabilities participating in the assessment.  Candidates requiring reasonable accommodations for any part of the assessment must request the accommodations via email to the State Department’s Office of Accessibility and Accommodation at  \n\noaa@state.gov at least three weeks before their assessment date.  Please ensure your email has a subject line that reads “Reasonable Accommodation Request for FSSA – Your name.”  Decisions for granting reasonable accommodations are made on a case-by-case basis.  \n\nForeign Service Specialist Assessment Summary  \n\nCandidates who take the assessment are asked to fill out several forms, including a Non- Disclosure Agreement and Conditions of Employment in the Foreign Service.  By signing the Non-Disclosure Agreement, candidates agree that they will not discuss the content of the assessment with anyone. This ensures that future assessments are fair for all candidates.  \n\nCandidates must log in to their FSSA sessions no later than the time indicated in their invitation letter or e-mail; late arrivals may be refused entry to the assessment.  The invitation will include necessary links for accessing the FSSA.  The assessment itself may take three to four hours over two days so candidates should plan their time accordingly.  The message  \n\nthat invites candidates to the assessment also informs candidates what documents or materials to have on hand.  In addition, candidates will be asked to provide the names and dates of birth of family members who might live with them overseas – this will facilitate the medical evaluation process.  \n\nCandidates are allowed to have water, coffee and/or soft drinks available during the assessment.  \n\nSuccessful Specialist candidates will demonstrate the following dimensions that reflect the skills, abilities, and personal qualities deemed essential to the work of the Foreign Service:  \n\nCRITICAL THINKING  \n\nTo discern what is appropriate, practical, and realistic in a given situation; to weigh relative merits of competing demands using sound judgment; to consider multiple points of view when making recommendations; to formulate creative alternatives or solutions to resolve problems; to show flexible and innovative thinking/problem solving.  \n\nCULTURAL ADAPTABILITY  \n\nTo work and communicate effectively and harmoniously with persons of other cultures, value systems, political beliefs, and economic circumstances; to recognize and respect differences in new and different cultural environments.  \n\nEXPERIENCE & MOTIVATION  \n\nTo demonstrate knowledge, skills or other attributes gained from previous experience of relevance to the Foreign Service; to articulate appropriate motivation for joining the Foreign Service.  \n\nINFORMATION INTEGRATION & ANALYSIS  \n\nTo evaluate the importance, reliability, and usefulness of information; to distill relevant details from available information; to absorb and retain complex information drawn from a variety of sources; to synthesize and analyze available information; to recognize patterns or trends and draw  \n\nreasoned conclusions from data.  \n\nLEADERSHIP  \n\nTo recognize and assume responsibility for work that needs to be done; to persist in the completion of a task; to influence a group’s activity or direction significantly; to motivate others to participate in the activity one is leading.  \n\nNEGOTIATION  \n\nTo recognize divergent and overlapping interests; to recognize advantages and disadvantages of agreement and available options; to advocate, influence and/or persuade others using information, facts, and reasoning rather than emotion; to resolve disagreements; to maintain or develop mutually beneficial working relationships with counterparts in the process.  \n\nOBJECTIVITY/INTEGRITY  \n\nTo be fair and honest to all employees and keep an open mind; to present issues frankly; to analyze facts and data effectively, without interjecting bias; to be consistent in words and actions; to be dependable.  \n\nPLANNING & ORGANIZING  \n\nTo prioritize and order tasks effectively, to employ a systematic approach to achieving objectives, to make appropriate use of limited resources.  \n\nPRESENTATION SKILLS  \n\nTo present fluently in a concise, grammatically correct, organized, and precise manner; to think on one’s feet, adjusting quickly to changing situations; to convey key elements and nuances of meaning accurately; to respond to questions from others effectively; to use appropriate styles of communication to fit the audience and purpose.  \n\nTEAMWORK  \n\nTo interact in a constructive, cooperative, and harmonious manner toward a common goal; to work effectively as a team player; to establish positive relationships and gain the confidence of others; to ease tension as appropriate.  \n\nWRITTEN COMMUNICATION  \n\nTo write concisely yet comprehensively; to use clear arguments and facts; to use correct grammar and syntax; to use appropriate vocabulary to promote understanding.  \n\nThe dimensions are the core of the Foreign Service Specialist Assessment process.  Candidates are encouraged to read the definitions of the dimensions carefully, and to spend some time thinking about what they mean.  While the definition of leadership, for example, may seem obvious, it is unlikely that everyone would focus on the same aspects of leadership as those highlighted by the Department’s definition.  \n\nCandidates’ qualifications and work experience are evaluated prior to the FSSA in the Qualifications Evaluation Panel (QEP) process and determine who receives an invitation to the assessment. On the day of the assessment, candidates are evaluated solely against the criteria above.  Two assessors observe each candidate in a variety of scenarios designed to enable the candidates to demonstrate the requisite skills and abilities.  Generally, the assessors are Foreign Service Officers from various career tracks and Foreign Service Specialists with expertise in the specialty for which the candidate is applying.  Assessors receive professional training on how to conduct assessments in an objective manner in order to observe and correlate each candidate’s performance with established performance standards.  \n\nThe assessment is not an adversarial process.  Candidates are not competing against other applicants for the same position but rather are judged on their capacity to demonstrate the skills and abilities necessary to be an effective Foreign Service Specialist.  \n\nThe Exercises in the Assessment  \n\nNOTE: sample assessment materials can be found in the last section of this guide  \n\nCase Management Exercise  \n\nIn this part of the FSSA, candidates are given a scenario describing issues which may typically arise within their specialty in a Foreign Service context. They have 45 minutes to read several realistic problems, analyze them, develop recommendations, and then write a logical and clear 1–2-page memo to their supervisor summarizing the situation and providing solutions to the problems identified.  Candidates do not need to know U.S. government or State Department rules and regulations – they should rely on their own knowledge and experience.  The timing of this exercise is deliberately tight, as the Written Communication dimension measures, among other things, how well a candidate writes under time pressure. Candidates use a computer to complete the writing exercise.  \n\nOnline Competency Exam  \n\nCandidates, except IMS candidates who took the Information Management Specialist Test (IMST) and OMS candidates who took the Office Management Specialist Test (OMST), take an online competency exam, which varies according to the specialty and lasts from 45-60 minutes.  The tests include Situational Judgement questions on competencies such as interpersonal, planning, and organizing skills.  These questions are intended to measure judgment in different situations, so they are somewhat ambiguous and candidates select both the best and worst course of action. Most of the online exams also include job knowledge questions related to the career track being tested, such as Microsoft usage, IT problems, hiring laws and procedures, organizing events and VIP schedules, building  \n\nmaintenance issues, contracting and leasing, logistics operations, and budgets and accounting. Some tests include an English knowledge and usage subtest, depending on the job requirements.  \n\nThe online exam is designed to present more questions than can generally be answered in the time allowed, so candidates should not expect to answer every question.  They should work quickly to answer as many questions correctly as possible in the time available.  \n\nThe Structured Interview  \n\nCandidates participate individually in a Structured Interview conducted by two assessors, one of whom will be a Subject Matter Expert proficient in the functional field being assessed.  For this portion of the FSSA, assessors will have reviewed portions of the candidate’s application for employment so they will be familiar with the work history and information provided in the biographical section of the application.  Candidates are expected to respond to questions based on their personal background, experience, and motivation.  Candidates should be careful to respond to the questions that are asked, rather than give a response that highlights their qualities or resume but does not respond to the specific question.  \n\nThis is a focused job interview designed to evaluate a candidate’s skills. Candidates will likely find it more formal and structured than other interviews they have experienced.  They should expect assessors to remain neutral throughout the interview.  Assessors will not provide any clues – including non-verbal ones – about candidates’ performance.  During the Structured Interview, assessors may interrupt a candidate, shuffle papers, or cut answers short.  Candidates should not assume that this signals anything either positive or negative.  \n\nThe Structured Interview portion of the assessment consists of three sections lasting 60 minutes.  The interview has a lot of ground to cover, so candidates will have only a few minutes to answer each question.  The time is controlled to give all candidates the same experience.  \n\nExperience and Motivation Questions  \n\nIn this portion of the Structured Interview, candidates should convey to the examiners a clear and precise picture of themselves, including their understanding of the Foreign Service. The assessors will consider candidates’ expressed motivation to join the Foreign Service, education and work experience and cross-cultural skills.  It is helpful to have previously informed yourself about the Foreign Service in general, and also about the work related to the specialty you have selected.  \n\nPast Behavior Questions  \n\nIn this segment of the Structured Interview, the assessors ask the candidate a series of questions to which the candidate should respond with examples from their own experience.  Candidates will be shown on the screen definitions of the dimensions being assessed during this portion of the interview, with two questions listed under each dimension.  Candidates will have sixty seconds to select the question they wish to discuss for each dimension (one question for each dimension) and to prepare their responses.  After one dimension is answered, the candidate will have sixty seconds to select and prepare the next dimension.  Candidates’ examples should be appropriate and drawn from their own experience.  During this portion of the Structured Interview, candidates should ensure their responses relate directly to the dimension and emphasize what they did in each situation, even if the work was done in a group.  \n\nHypothetical Scenarios  \n\nThis part of the Structured Interview consists of a series of hypothetical scenarios designed to test the candidate's situational judgment.  Although the problems presented in this exercise are hypothetical, they are closely related to real-life situations regularly encountered by Foreign Service Specialists overseas. Candidates are advised, however, that, while the problems occur in a Foreign Service setting, they are not expected to know how an Embassy operates or to be familiar with government rules and regulations.  Rather, they are asked to offer a solution that employs good judgment and knowledge of their desired specialty.  \n\nEvaluating the Three Exercises  \n\nAssessors read or listen to the candidate's answers carefully and individually enter their scores for the Case Management Exercise and the Structured Interview into a master score sheet.  The test score for candidates who took the Information Management Specialist Test (IMST) or other specialty job knowledge test is entered into the master score sheet.  The average of the three exercises determines a candidate’s overall score.  The Online Exam or IMST, Structured Interview, and Case Management Exercise each count for one-third of the total score.  Overall scoring is on a scale from 1 to 7, with 1 representing poor performance and 7 representing outstanding performance.  The assessment cut-off to continue a candidacy is 5.25.  \n\nAssessment Results  \n\nCandidates receive the results of the assessment by e-mail within two business days following the FSSA.  Along with their final overall score, candidates receive an indication as to whether they reached the 5.25 level on any of the three major components of the assessment.  \n\nThose candidates who pass the assessment and sign any appropriate physical requirements forms, receive a Conditional Offer of Appointment and proceed to the next phase of the hiring process.  Successful candidates are also given information on the next steps in the Foreign Service Specialist Selection Process, including information on the security background investigation, extra points for language proficiency and veteran's preference, the process to meet minimum medical qualifications, and suitability review.  \n\nSample Foreign Service Specialist Assessment Materials  \n\nThe following materials provide candidates with an idea of the kinds of questions and exercises they will encounter during their Specialist Assessment.  They should be seen as illustrative only.  They are not the actual questions and exercises that will be encountered on the assessment day, nor do they necessarily reflect the difficulty or the length of such questions and exercises.  \n\nCase Management  \n\nThe sample Case Management Exercise presented below is a generic one that is intended to illustrate the format and kinds of questions that will be asked.  It does not apply specifically to any of the specialties.  \n\nSituation:  When you arrive at your new post, your supervisor asks for your recommendations for how to address a number of current problems in your section because you have a “fresh perspective.”  Here are the three main problems your supervisor wants you to address.  \n\n1.  Your supervisor recently read an article that showed how another embassy significantly increased its customer service ratings by employing an automated feedback survey for clients.  Your supervisor wants you to outline a plan to examine the feasibility of using this program in your section.  \n\n2.  Your supervisor believes that the local and American employees in your section have formed their own cliques. There is little interaction between these groups at lunch time or after hours.  Your supervisor thinks this is affecting office morale and productivity, and wants some ideas on how to improve the situation.  \n\n3.  Your section has always closed down at noon for lunch and re-opened at 1:00 p.m.  Your supervisor wants the unit open all day and asks for your suggestions on how to manage this. The employees who staff the unit strongly prefer this schedule and will be resistant to change.  \n\nYour Task:  Your supervisor wants you to draft a 1-2 page memo (singlespaced), outlining your recommendations to address each problem.  \n\nHypothetical Questions  \n\n1. You are the Financial Management Officer (FMO) at a medium-sized Embassy in a developing country. When reviewing mid-year budget expenditures, you notice that one of the sections has spent nearly their full year’s allotment of funding.  With six months left in the fiscal year and funds very tight, what do you do and why?  \n\n2.  You are the General Services Officer (GSO) at a large Embassy.  You discover that one of the section heads has purchased expensive coffee table books to give to his contacts as holiday presents.  He did not go through the regular procurement procedures and now wants you to reimburse him the several hundred dollars he spent on these books.  What do you do and why?  \n\n3.  You are the regional Human Resources Officer (HRO) for several posts.  One post has never had an employee handbook, another does not follow any standard procedures for hiring new employees, and at a third one, local employees threaten to stage a protest over their lack of pay increases for the past three years.  Visiting each of these posts requires two days of travel and time on the ground.  How would you approach these problems?  \n\n4.  You are the health care provider at your post.  The Ambassador wants you to notify them every time an employee is too sick to come to work so the Ambassador may send a get-well card.  You respond that you do not think that would be appropriate, but the Ambassador insists, citing their role as Chief of Mission.  What do you do?  \n\n5.  You are the Office Management Specialist (OMS) in the Management Section of a medium-sized embassy.  Many of your coworkers go to your boss with requests that they feel have not been addressed by other embassy sections.  Some of these coworkers have come to believe that you have influence over your boss’s decisions whether to approve their requests.  They raise their problems with you during social events such as barbecues or community picnics.  How do you respond to these approaches?  \n\n6.  You are the sole Information Management Specialist (IMS) at a small embassy.  Your home bureau in Washington has just notified posts in your region that it has some unexpected, extra end-of-year funding to support new IT equipment requests, and it asks posts to submit requests if they have needs for supplemental funding.  Such requests must be submitted within the next 48 hours.  What steps to do you take to decide how to respond to this development?  \n\nOnline Competency Exam  \n\nJob Knowledge  \n\nThis section of the online competency exam is a multiple-choice test asking candidates to choose the correct answer from the options presented.  The questions asked will be related to the specialty for which the candidate is applying, covering such topics as construction, contracting, budgeting,  \n\nfacilities management, project management, supervision, and information technology.  \n\nThe list of sample Job Knowledge questions below is intended solely to give candidates an idea of the kinds of material they will see in this part of the online competency exam. It does not cover all the topics that may be included.  \n\n1.  Which is the following is the most common reason for indoor air quality problems?  \n\na.  Inadequate ventilation b. Building products c. Outside air pollution d.  Bioaerosols  \n\n2.  Manual fire alarm pull stations should be located next to which of the following?  \n\na. Mechanical rooms   \nb. Elevators   \nc. Exits   \nd. Restrooms  \n\n3.  Financial ratios measuring a company's ability to pay its bills in the near future without undue stress are known as what kind of ratios?  \n\na.  Long-term solvency b. Short-term solvency c. Asset management d.  Profitability  \n\n4.  An unauthorized person agreed to and signed a contract for the delivery of office products. The most appropriate response would be to try to:  \n\na.  Uphold the agreement with the vendor.   \nb.  Gain official approval before delivery. c.  Cancel the order before delivery.   \nd. Review and renegotiate the contract as appropriate.  \n\n5.  Which of the following statements about the prevention of sexual harassment is most correct?  \n\na.  Businesses should enforce a zero tolerance for sexual harassment.   \nb. Harassment-prevention training programs have proven to be ineffective.   \nc.  The behavior of women is the cause of harassment in one-third of the cases.   \na.  Policies defining penalties for harassment need to be narrow and specific in order to be enforceable.  \n\n6.  What is the most efficient way to install an operating system?  \n\na.  Upgrade from the previous version.   \nb.  Install setup.exe from a USB.   \nc.  Install setup.exe from a network.   \nd. Image the new machine from a known good image.  \n\nSituational Judgment  \n\nThis section of the online competency exam is a multiple-choice test asking candidates to supply the best answer choice and the worst answer choice from the options presented.  The topics covered by the questions cover communication, interpersonal skills, conflict resolution, cross- cultural skills, customer service, teamwork, adaptability, decision-making, planning, time management, supervision, and various job-specific judgment situations.  \n\nThe list of sample Situation Judgment questions below is intended solely to give candidates an idea of the kinds of material they will see in this part of the online competency exam. It does not cover all the topics that may be included.  \n\n1.  You are working directly with a local government official.  You and the official do not personally get along, and you feel that everything you say and agree upon is adjusted later without your approval.  You are getting increasingly frustrated that your agreements are not honored.  Your attempts at diplomatically addressing the situation with the official have not been successful.  What would you do?  \n\na.  Ask the Ambassador at your post to have a conversation with the local government official.   \nb.  Directly confront the local government official about the changes and insist they stop.   \nc.  Just put up with the official to build rapport and trust in the future.   \nd. Document everything each of you says in an email log of agreements and decisions.  \n\n2.  You are responsible for overseeing procurements and expenses.  A nonstandard procurement request lands on your desk.  The requesting officer is a friend and says that quick approval is important.  However, because it is non-standard, policy states that a more thorough evaluation process must take place.  What would you do?  \n\na.  Tell the officer that friendship aside, you have to follow policy.   \nb.  Tell the officer you will expedite the request as best you can, but that it still must be completed vetted.   \nc.  Expedite the request as a favor and do sufficient follow up to ensure it was valid.   \nd. Give the request to another employee in your section to evaluate and approve.  \n\n3.  You are treating a patient and explaining a medicine and its possible side effects.  The patient is nodding but you are unsure about how well she comprehends what you say.  What would you do?  \n\na.  Use both technical medical terms and lay person terms to ensure comprehension. b.  Speak slowly and deliberately so the patient can keep up and listen.  \n\nc.  Write down your instructions and side effects so the patient can read them again later.   \nd.  Ask if there is a spouse or friend to whom you also can give the information.  \n\n4.  You have created a two-day training program on teambuilding and cross-cultural understanding for locally employed staff.  You will have 20 attendees to train.  You are informed that the attendees will only be available for one day after your arrival due to a national holiday in your host country.  To complicate matters, you scheduled them to perform work based on the training immediately.  What would you do?  \n\na.  Cut the training material down to one day, knowing you will omit information, and leave the rest to on-the-job training after the holiday.   \nb.  Perform day one of training as planned and let attendees take the notes from day two to read on their own over the holiday.   \nc.  Send the training materials in advance for the attendees to read and prepare, and adjust the training session to one day.  \n\n5.  A coworker asked you to help on a difficult procedure you knew how to do, but you were about to start your own work for the day. What would you do?  \n\na.  I would tell my coworker where to look up the procedure.   \nb. I would show my coworker how to do the work.   \nc.  I would tell my coworker who else to ask for help.   \nd.  I would let my coworker figure it out and learn independently.  \n\nOffice Management Specialist  \n\nThe Office Management Specialist (OMS) online competency exam contains several sections that apply only to OMS candidates.  In addition to Situational Judgment questions, the exam includes sections on  \n\nProofing, Reading Comprehension, Data Entry, and Data Lookup  \n\nProofing  \n\nThis section will present text and ask you to identify errors and make improvements.  It is designed to measure your grammar, spelling, punctuation, and word choice (vocabulary).  There are two types of items.  \n\nExample Item 1:  \n\nA missed or misunderstood message on an important or sensitive matter can have a more profound effect on the Embassy's work then might be the case in other sections.  \n\n(1)  \n\nFor underlined section 1, which of the following is correct:  \n\na.  work then might b. work than might c.  workings then might d. workings than might  \n\nReading Comprehension  \n\nThis section will ask you to read a passage and then answer questions based on the content.  It is designed to assess your skill in understanding the meaning of written documents.  \n\nExample Item:  \n\nYou will be dealing with the highest level of contacts that your Post has in the local government, community, Diplomatic Corps, and also in the State Department and at other USG agencies in Washington. The implication is that you will always need to be extremely courteous, careful, and discreet in dealing with people by phone or in person.  \n\nWhich of the following statements is false or not known based on the passage?  \n\na.  You will deal with high level contacts via the phone.   \nb.  You will need to be courteous and discreet at all times.   \nc.  You will be doing community outreach at your Post.   \nd.  You will be interacting with people in the Diplomatic Corps.  \n\nData Entry  \n\nThis section asks you to enter information into form fields.  It is designed to assess your skill at recording information quickly and accurately.  \n\nExample Item:  \n\n(April 19, 2:36 pm). I’m trying to reach Pat Smith.  This is Hollie Kotani with International Action. I would appreciate it if you could call me at 942-409- 0677.  I would like to invite you to be our keynote speaker at our annual conference.  \n\nAnswer:  You would type the relevant information from the above message into the appropriate web form.  \n\nData Lookup  \n\nThis section presents a series of tables and charts and asks you to answer questions based on the data in the charts. It is designed to assess your skill at quickly and accurately looking up information.  \n\nExample Item:  \n\nTABLEOFMAXIMUMSAllowableExpensesperGuest$10.00Luncheon n（restaurant)$25.00Coffee Drinks$5.00 $6.00Cocktail/Buffet Breakfast(athome)$7.50Dinner (athome)$35.00Brunch/Lunch$7.50$10.00Dinner (restaurant)$40.00Breakfast(restaurant)$20.00Cocktail/Reception$7.50Luncheon(athome)  \n\nWhat is the maximum allowance per guest for a dinner at home?  \n\na. \\$20.00   \nb. \\$25.00   \nc. \\$35.00   \nd.   \\$40.00", "files_in_pdf": [{"path": "extract/FSSA_Information_Guide_1751184470/images/mwc52i.jpg", "size": 106815}]}
