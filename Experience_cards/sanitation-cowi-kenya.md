## Sanitation Expert (Hydraulics)

**Organization:** COWI A/S  
**Location:** Kenya  
**Duration:** September 2016 - January 2018

### Context
Development of a 40-year sanitation masterplan for Nairobi City and Selected Satellite Towns, addressing rapid urbanization, informal settlement growth, and environmental challenges in a major East African metropolis.

### Key Responsibilities
1. Formulate long-term sanitation master plan for Nairobi and satellite towns
2. Lead field assessments and data analysis for infrastructure investment planning
3. Model conventional and simplified sewer collection systems
4. Conduct advanced hydraulic modeling using specialized software
5. Prepare actionable recommendations for urgent system upgrades
6. Develop sanitation strategies for informal settlements
7. Update and expand GIS database for water and sanitation infrastructure
8. Establish project design standards and criteria

### Major Achievements
1. Developed a 25-year Hydraulic Masterplan benefiting over 5 million current residents, expandable to 8.5 million by 2040
2. Led development of a phased $50M infrastructure investment plan
3. Modeled over 500km of existing and proposed sewer networks

### Technical Highlights
- Used advanced modeling software (SewerGEMS, SWMM) for system analysis
- Designed decentralized treatment systems for 20 informal settlements (50,000 residents each)
- Created a digital elevation model with 1m contour accuracy for the entire 3000 kmÂ² study area

### Key Metrics
- Planned sanitation improvements to increase sewerage coverage from 40% to 80% of urban population
- Mapped 400 km of previously undocumented sewer lines

### Skills Demonstrated
- Long-term strategic planning for urban sanitation
- Large-scale infrastructure investment planning and phasing
- Advanced hydraulic modeling and GIS database management
- Urban planning and informal settlement upgrading strategies
- Integration of conventional and non-conventional sanitation solutions

### Relevant Training/Certifications
- Advanced SewerGEMS and SWMM modeling (online course)
- Urban Sanitation Planning (IHE Delft short course)

### Collaborations/Partnerships
- Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company
- Kenya's Ministry of Water and Sanitation
- UN-Habitat (for informal settlement strategies)
- World Bank (project funder)
